Everything right is wrong again
Just like in The Long, Long Trailer
All the dishes got broken and the car kept driving
And nobody would stop to save her
Wake me when it's over, touch my face
Tell me every word has been erased
Don't you want to know the reason
Why the cupboard's not appealing
Don't you get the feeling that
Everything that's right is wrong again
You're a weasel overcome with dinge
Weasel overcome but not before the damage done
The healing doesn't stop the feeling
Everything right is wrong again
Just like in The Long, Long Trailer
All the dishes got broken and the car kept driving
And nobody would stop to save her
And now the song is over now
And now the song is over now
And now the song is over now
The song is over now
Everything right is wrong again
Every movement false, every four is waltz again
Every five and dime's been gained and spent
Tell me that you like my float upstream
Draw the line dividing laugh and scream
You know everything that I know so I know
You've heard the voice that makes the silent noise
That says that
Everything that's right is wrong again
You're a weasel overcome with dinge
Weasel overcome but not before the damage done
The healing doesn't stop the feeling
Everything right is wrong again
Just like in The Long, Long Trailer
All the dishes got broken and the car kept driving
And nobody would stop to save her
And now the song is over now
And now the song is over now
And now the song is over now
The song is over now

As your body floats down Third Street
With the burn-smell factory closing up
Yes it's sad to say you will romanticize
All the things you've known before
It was not not not so great
It was not not not so great
And as you take a bath in that beaten path
There's a pounding at the door
Well it's a mighty zombie talking of some love and posterity
He says "The good old days never say good-bye
If you keep this in your mind:
You need some lo-lo-loving arms
You need some lo-lo-loving arms"
And as you fall from grace the only words you say are:
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Ads up in the subway are the work of someone
Trying to please their boss
And though the guy's a pig we all know what he wants
Is just to please somebody else
If the pu-pu-puppet head
Was only bu-bu-busted in
It'd be a better thing for everyone involved
And we wouldn't have to cry
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Memo to myself: Do the dumb things I gotta do
Touch the puppet head
Quit my job down at the carwash
Didn't have to write no one a goodbye note
That said, "The check's in the mail, and
I'll see you in church, and don't you ever change"
If the pu-pu-puppet head
Was only bu-bu-busted in
I'll see you after school
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside the puppet head
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside
Put your hand inside the puppet head

There's only two songs in me and I just wrote the third
Don't know where I got the inspiration or how I wrote the words
Spent my whole life just digging up my music's shallow grave
For the two songs in me and the third one I just made
A rich man once told me, "Hey, life's a funny thing"
A poor man once told me that he can't afford to speak
Now I'm in the middle like a bird without a beak 
'Cause there's just two songs in me and I just wrote the third
Don't know where I got the inspiration or how I wrote the words
Spent my whole life just digging up my music's shallow grave
For the two songs in me and the third one I just made
So I went to the President, and I asked old what's-his-name
Has he ever gotten writer's block, or something like the same
He just started talking like he was on TV
"If there's just two songs in ya, boy, whaddaya want from me?"
So I bought myself some denim pants and a silver guitar
But I politely told the ladies, "You'll still have to call me Sir
Because I have to keep my self-respect - I'll never be a star
Since there's just two songs in me, and this is Number Three"

Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world
That you're my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around
When you are alone
You are the cat, you are the phone
You are an animal
The words I'm singing now
Mean nothing more than "meow"
To an animal
Wake up and smell the cat food
In your bank account
Don't try to stop the tail
That wags the hound
D, world destruction
Over an overture
N, do I need
Apostrophe T, need this torture?
Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world
That you're my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around
No one in the world
Ever gets what they want
And that is beautiful
Everybody dies
Frustrated and sad
And that is beautiful
They want what they're not
And I wish they would stop
Saying Deputy Dawg dog a ding dang depadepa
Deputy Dawg dog a ding dang depadepa
D, world destruction
Over an overture
N, do I need
Apostrophe T, need this torture?
Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world
That you're my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around
I don't want to live in this world anymore
I don't want to live in this world
Don't, don't, don't let's start
This is the worst part
Could believe for all the world
That you're my precious little girl
But don't, don't, don't let's start
I've got a weak heart
And I don't get around how you get around

Hide away, folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya (someone's gonna get ya)
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away, folk family
Better hide away
Better hide away 
Tippy toe to the front door, Mother
'Cause there's a guy with a long, long fuse
And the one thing you can't hide
Is all the fear you feel inside
As the fuse is spelling out these words
Hide away, folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya (someone's gonna get ya)
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away, folk family
Better hide away
Better hide away
Tippy toe to the flatbed, Father
Because they're pouring out our gasoline
And sadly the cross-eyed bear's
Been put to sleep behind the stairs (sadly)
And his shoes are laced with irony
Hide away, folk family
Or else someone's gonna get ya (someone's gonna get ya)
Someone's gonna get ya
Hide away, folk family 
Better hide away
Better hide away
"Hello, this is Lesley Down with the Daily Home Astrology Report:
Taurus, contemplate domestic turmoil
Aquarius, abandon hope for future plans..."

Hide away, folk family
Better hide away
Better hide away

32 footsteps leading to the room where the paint doesn't want to dry
32 footsteps running down the road where the dirt reaches the sky
32 feathers in my brand new Indian headdress
32 new moons shining in 32 skies
What's the reason? Why'd she go?
Where's my baby? I don't know
32 footsteps, counted them myself, 32 footsteps
Bing bang bingalong cing cang cingalong
Ding dang dingalong day
Fing fang fingalong ging gang gingalong

Where's my baby? I don't know
32 footsteps, counted them myself, 32 footsteps
32 lies my ears never saw when the floorboards gave way
32 walls come tumbling down and the night turns to day
32 infantrymen running in place
32 boxcars, all of them have your face
What's the reason? Why'd she leave?
Don't you know we're on the eve of
32 footsteps? Counted them myself, 32 footsteps

In the mornin' sun 'round seven o'clock
The parking lot fills around Toys-R-Us
And my little girl, she will get away
Ride her bike down Toddler Hiway
Take your Close'n'Play

(Lord, please don't take me away.)
Rabid child stays at home, talks on a CB
Truckers pass calling out their handles to the kid
Chess Piece Face and The Big Duluth call her every day
"Hammer down" and "rabbit ears" are the only words they know
(Hammer down)
(Hammer down, rabbit ears)
(Hammer down, rabbit ears)
(Hammer down, rabbit ears, hammer down)
If you pass the rabid child say "hammer down" for me
The rabid child
The rabid child

All the people are so happy now
Their heads are cavin' in 
I'm glad they are a snowman with
Protective rubber skin
But every little thing's a domino
That falls on different dots
And crashes into everything
That tries to make it stop
And the mirror, it reflects
A tiny dancin' skeleton 
Surrounded by a fleshy overcoat
And swaddled in
A furry hat, elastic mask
A pair of shiny marble dice
Some people call them snake eyes
But to me they look like mice
And nothing's smellin' like a rose 
But I don't care if no one's coming up for air 
'Cause I know nothing's gonna change my clothes
Ever anymore

She's got her ear to the walls
And she's tappin' the calls
If you've got a secret, boy
Forget about it, 'cause she's a
Hotel Detective
My little
Hotel Detective
Yeah she's a
Hotel Detective
Why don't you check her out?
Well the bellhop is funky
The dumbwaiter's a monkey
If there's a knock at the door, boy
Forget about it, 'cause she's a
Hotel Detective
My little

Yeah

Come on and check her out
She says she likes my face
She says she owns the place

From the top of a tree

And make me feel like a bee
Hotel Detective
That's where I want to know you

I met someone at the dog show
She was holding my left arm 
But everyone was acting normal
So I tried to look nonchalant
We both said, "I really love you"
The Shriners loaned us cars
We raced up and down the sidewalk
Twenty thousand million times 
Why did they send her over anyone else?
How should I react?
These things happen to other people
They don't happen at all, in fact
When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things
I heard they had a space program
When they sing you can't hear, there's no air
Sometimes I think I kind of like that and
Other times I think I'm already there 
Gonna ask for my admission
Gonna speak to the man in charge
The secretary says he's on another line
Can I hold for a long, long time?
I found out she's an angel
I don't think she knows I know
I'm worried that something might happen to me
If anyone ever finds out
Why? Why did they send her over anyone else?
How should I react?
These things happen to other people
They don't happen at all
When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest things
I heard they had a space program
When they sing you can't hear, there's no air
Sometimes I think I kind of like that and
Other times I think I'm already there
When you're following an angel
Does it mean you have to throw your body off a building?
Somewhere they're meeting on a pinhead 
Calling you an angel, calling you the nicest thing

Youth culture killed my dog
And I don't think it's fair (I don't think it's fair)
And his suicide can be justified
By the tastemakers, how they cried and cried and so
Bacharach and David used to write his favorite songs
Never would he worry, he'd just run and fetch the ball
But the night lights and my dog's life aren't exactly one and the same
Youth culture killed my dog
And I don't think it's fair (I don't think it's fair)
And the judgement made in the city of hate
Just broke his spirit so
Bacharach and David used to write his favorite songs
Never, never, never would he worry, he'd just run and fetch the ball
But the hiphop and the white funk just blew away my puppy's mind
I don't understand what you did to my dog

"Daddy'll sing bass"
"Daddy'll sing bass"
"Daddy'll sing bass"
"Daddy'll sing bass"
I took my boat for a car
I took that car for a ride
I was trying to get somewhere
But now I'm following
The traces of your fingernails
That run along the windshield
On the boat of car
"Daddy'll sing bass"
Traces of your fingernails
That run along the windshield
On the boat of car
On the boat of car
On the boat of car

I was born in a lighthouse, my mother was the sea
I crawled to school each morning, when it occurred to me
That life's just a mood ring we're not allowed to see
And this is what it said to me
My room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
Now listen all you swingers, don't you try to tag along
I know monkey see, but monkey's dead, for you it would be wrong
Put a dime in my jukebox, you'll only hear this song
And it won't be fun for long
Because my room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
Thank you
Thank you
My room is comfortably small
With rubber lining the walls
And there's someone always calling my name
He calls when I'm alone
And he calls when I'm not home
And he calls when I'm stuck out in the rain
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane
I'm insane

What's gonna happen to Chess Piece Face?
There go I but for my face
All I know could be defaced
By the facts in the life of Chess Piece Face
I don't know where he lives
Or if he knows to sail
Or if little schemes like this one
Ever cross his trail
But I don't believe he's dreaming
Or if he cares to know
So I shudder in my lampshade
So what's gonna happen to Chess Piece Face?
There go I but for my face

Sometimes I feel like being wispy
And once in a while I feel like being dry
But we're doomed and we're drowned
By this feeling we surround
So I hope that I get old before I die
Ohhhhh
It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
And I wonder why this hasn't happened
Why, why, why
And I think about the dirt that I'll be wearing for a shirt
And I hope that I get old before I die
Clear off the kitchen table darling
For on the kitchen table I must lie
I'm just tired for my wife
Served the banquet of my life
And I hope that I get old before I die
Ohhhhh
It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
And I wonder why this hasn't happened
Why, why, why
And I think about the dirt that I'll be wearing for a shirt
And I hope that I get old before I die
Ohhhhh
It's a long, long rope they use to hang you soon I hope
And I wonder why this hasn't happened
Why, why, why
And I think about the dirt that I'll be wearing for a shirt
And I hope that I get old before I die

This song is dedicated to all you modern day troubadours out there
And I think I know who you are
I gotta get a job
I got to get some pay
My son's gotta go to art school
He's leavin' in three days
And the TV is in Esperanto
You know that that's a bitch
But alienation's for the rich
And I'm feelin' a-poorer every day
A-hey hey hey
Well I ain't feelin' happy
About the state of things in my life
But I'm workin' to make it better
With a six of Miller High Life
Just drinkin' and a-drivin'
A-makin' sure my dues get paid
Because alienation's for the rich
And I'm feelin' a-poorer every day
A-hey hey hey
Ah hahahaha!
Well I ain't feelin' happy

The day Marvin Gaye
And Phil Ochs got married
The trees all waved
Their giant arms
And happiness bled
From every street corner
And biplanes bombed
With fluffy pillows

In a world we call our home there's lots of room to roam
Plenty of time to turn mistakes into rhyme
There's a place for those who love their poetry
It's just across from the sign that says, "Pros Only" 
So if you like a band with a chick singer,
Say your cup of tea is a wall of trombones
If you dig Menudo, or MDC we salute you the way we know
For every one with dollar signs in his eyes
There must be hundreds that look at you as if you're some kind of
Rhythm section want ad
No others need apply to the rhythm section want ad
I'll tell you why
Hats off to the new age hairstyle made of bones
Hats off to the use of hats as megaphones
Speak softly, drive a Sherman tank
Laugh hard, it's a long way to the bank
Do you sing like Olive Oyl on purpose
You guys must be into the Eurythmics
For every one with dollar signs in his eyes
There must be hundreds that look at you as if you're some kind of
Rhythm section want ad
No others need apply to the rhythm section want ad
And here's the reason why

Make a hole with a gun perpendicular
To the name of this town in a desktop globe
Exit wound in a foreign nation
Showing the home of the one this was written for
My apartment looks upside down from there
Water spirals the wrong way out the sink
And her voice is a backwards record
It's like a whirlpool, and it never ends
(Ann)
Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked in the glow
Of each other's majestic presence
(Listen Ann)
Listen Ana hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say
If there was a me for you
All alone at the '64 World's Fair
Eighty dolls yelling "Small girl after all"
Who was at the DuPont Pavilion?
Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there?
Or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
To the horn on the pole at the bus depot
And in back of the edge of hearing
These are the words that the voice was repeating:
(Ann)
Ana Ng and I are getting old
And we still haven't walked in the glow
Of each other's majestic presence
(Listen Ann)
Listen Ana hear my words
They're the ones you would think I would say
If there was a me for you
When I was driving once I saw this painted on a bridge:
"I don't want the world, I just want your half"
They don't need me here and I know you're there
Where the world goes by like the humid air
And it sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks until it goes away
And the truth is we don't know anything
(Ann)
Ana Ng and I are getting old

I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
And that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
The yellow Roosevelt
Avenue leaf overturned
The ardor of arboreality
Is an adventure
We have spurned, we've spurned
A new leaf overturned
It's a new leaf overturned
And so I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
And that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
We yearn to swim for home
But our only home is bone
How sleepless is the egg
Knowing that which throws the stone
Foresees the bone, the bone
Our only home is bone
Our only home is bone
And so I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
And that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
Yes I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
And that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
Yes I'm gonna see (I'm gonna see)
The cow (the cow)
Beneath the sea

Lie still, little bottle, and shake my shaky hand
Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
I know I must investigate
I hope that I can sing along
"There's no time for metaphors," cried the little pill to me
He said, "Life is a placebo masquerading as a simile."
Well, I knew that pill was lying
Too gregarious, too nice
But as he walked I had to sing this twice
Lie still, little bottle
Don't twist, it ain't twistin' time
With every move you make you just disintegrate my ever-troubled mind
Lie still, little bottle, and shake my shaky hand
Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
I know I must investigate
I hope that I can sing along
Lie still, little bottle
Lie still
Lie still, little bottle
Lie still
Lie still
Lie still

I remember the year I went to camp
I heard about some lady named Selma and some blacks
Somebody put their fingers in the President's ears
It wasn't too much later they came out with Johnson's wax
I remember the book depository where they crowned the king of Cuba
Now that's all I can think of, but I'm sure there's something else
Way down inside me I can feel it coming back
Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings you down
(Purple toupee when summer brings you down)
Purple toupee and gold lamé will turn your brain around
(Purple toupee and gold lamé)
Chinese people were fighting in the park
We tried to help them fight, no one appreciated that
Martin X was mad when they outlawed bell bottoms
Ten years later they were sharing the same cell
I shouted out, "Free the Expo '67"
Till they stepped on my hair, and they told me I was fat
Now I'm very big, I'm a big important man
And the only thing that's different is underneath my hat
Purple toupee will show the way when summer brings you down
(Purple toupee when summer brings you down)
Purple toupee and gold lamé will turn your brain around
(Purple toupee and gold lamé)
Purple toupee is here to stay after the hair has gone away
The purple brigade is marching from the grave
La la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la la 
La la la
We're on some kind of mission
We have an obligation
We have to wear toupees

Somebody's reading your mind
Damned if you know who it is
They're digging through all of your files
Stealing back your best ideas 
You cover your windows with lead
Even keeping the pets outside
Then you hear, a moment too late
This sound coming over the phone
"This is the spawning of the cage and aquarium
Don't wait a moment too soon
Used to be different
Now you're the same
Yawn as your plane goes down in flames
"This is the spawning of the cage and aquarium
Don't wait a moment too soon
Used to be different
Now you're the same
Yawn as your plane goes down in flames"

Where your eyes don't go a filthy scarecrow waves its broomstick arms 
And does a parody of each unconscious thing you do
When you turn around to look it's gone behind you
On its face it's wearing your confused expression
Where your eyes don't go
Where your eyes don't go a part of you is hovering
It's a nightmare that you'll never be discovering
You're free to come and go
Or talk like Kurtis Blow
But there's a pair of eyes in back of your head
Every jumbled pile of person has a thinking part 
that wonders what the part that isn't thinking isn't thinking of
Should you worry when the skullhead is in front of you,
Or is it worse because it's always waiting
Where your eyes don't go?
Where your eyes don't go a part of you is hovering
It's a nightmare that you'll never be discovering
You're free to come and go
Or talk like Kurtis Blow
But there's a pair of eyes in back of your head
Where your eyes don't go a filthy scarecrow waves its broomstick arms 
And does a parody of each unconscious thing you do
When you turn around to look it's gone behind you
On its face it's wearing your confused expression
Where your eyes don't go

Piece of dirt 
That is all I'm standing on today
Piece of dirt 
The whole world has slipped away
I would climb the highest mountain 
Just to jump into a fountain
Or to fly
I'd fly away
A woman's voice on the radio 
Can convince you you're in love
A woman's voice on the telephone 
Can convince you you're alone
But I set my sails so long ago 
They've revoked my sailor's badge
Said I should be content and happy 
On this ink spot where I stand
Piece of dirt
That is all I'm standing on today
Piece of dirt
The whole world has slipped away
I find myself haunted 
By a spooky man named Me
I wish that I 
Could jump out of my skin

Once a boy named Mister Me bemoaned a great regret:
"I've floundered in the misty sea but can't abide its mystery
I wound up sad, you bet"
So onward go and Edward Ho into the bounding main
Enjoy the show look out below but mind the misty sea
Or end up sad like Mister Me
He ended up sad
He ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad
He ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
So take the hand of Mister Me and, mister, make him glad
To swim the Mister Misty Sea and cease the Mister Mystery
That, mister, made him sad
He ended up sad
He ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad
He ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad
He ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad
He ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad

The possible dream
Finale of seem
The moment that some call eternal
That some call insane
Now helmets on each head 
Awaiting the first lead
The pageant is named the pencil rain
The infantry stands
And holds out its hands
The marshal's binoculars focus 
And skyward they train
They're searching the yonder blue
They look out for number two
The heraldry of the pencil rain
[in Morse code] "Ay, ay, ay, canta no llores"
And now hear the roar 
That none can ignore
The thunderous clatter of splintering wood 
And lives that are claimed
And none who have witnessed all
Can speak of a nobler cause 
Than perishing in the pencil rain
The pencil rain
The pencil rain
The pencil rain

I know you deceived me
Couldn't sleep last night
Now my tearstains on the wall reflect an ugly sight
I can see your secrets
No need to confess
Everyone looks naked when you know the world's address
The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
The world's address
Life's parade of fashion
Just leaves me depressed
Under every garment I can see the world's address
Call the men of science
And let them hear this song
Tell them Albert Einstein and Copernicus were wrong
The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
The world's address
Call the men of science
And let them hear this song
Tell them Albert Einstein and Copernicus were wrong
The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll repeat it for those who may not have already guessed
The world's address
A place that's worn
A sad pun that reflects a sadder mess
I'll say it one more time for those who may not have already guessed
The world's address

Get out of the car
Put down the phone
Take off that stupid looking hat you wear
I'm gonna die if you touch me one more time
Well I guess that I'm going to die no matter what
Love people are there
The smell of love is everywhere
You think it's always sensitive and good
You think that I want to be understood
I've got a match
Your embrace and my collapse
Beat up the cat if you need someone else on the mat
I put a rock in the coffee in your coffee mug
Which one of us is the one that we can't trust?
You say that I think it's you but I don't agree with that
Love people are there
The smell of love is everywhere
You think it's always sensitive and good
You think that I want to be understood
I've got a match
Your embrace and my collapse
Even when we get along
I've got a match
Your embrace and my collapse
Love people are there
The smell of love is everywhere
Why can't you be sensitive and good?
Why don't you want to be understood?
I've got a match
Your embrace and my collapse
I've got a match
Your embrace and my collapse

Once a year, my friend puts on a red suit
And hangs around with me and my wife
Now I can't help but feeling jealous
Each time she climbs on his knee
And she stands beneath the mistletoe, screaming
For him to stand beneath the mistletoe, screaming
Now I can't help but feeling jealous
Each time she climbs on his knee
Why must she climb on his knee? 
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
She kissed him once and whispered in his ear
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
I wish he would go
He's breaking up my home
She always had this twisted side to her
But she'd never drag my name around town
But lately she's been humming cheating songs
And I don't like that fat guy around
No I don't like that fat guy around
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
She kissed him once and whispered in his ear
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
I wish he would go
He's breaking up my home
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
Thrilling (thrilling)
Christmas (Christmas)
Trembling fear
I saw my baby wearing Santa's beard
I wish he would go
He's breaking up my home

You'll always miss
My big ol' body
In its prime and never shoddy
While bloodhounds wait down in the lobby
You'll eulogize my big ol' body
You'll miss me
With effigies
Lighting up your house like X-mas trees
As tears roll down, below your knees
You'll miss me
With effigies
Go find a man to fit my shoes
Left one's old and the right one's new
And I bought the right one, just for you
Go find a man to fit my shoes
You'll see my teeth in the stars above
Every tree a finger of my glove
And every time push comes to shove
You'll see my teeth in the stars above
Your money talks but my genius walks
Morticians wait with a shovel and a fork
As detectives trace my hands with chalk
Your money talks but my genius walks
You'll miss me so
You will miss me
It must be raining 'cause a man ain't supposed to cry
But I look up and I don't see a cloud

Love sees love's happiness
But happiness can't see that love is sad
That love is sad 
Sadness is hanging there
To show love somewhere something needs a change
They need a change
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
To take the house he built for her apart
To make it break
It's gonna take
A metal ball hung from a chain
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
To pick the broken ruins up again
To mend her heart
To help him start
To see a world apart from pain
Lad's gal is all he has
Gal's gladness hangs upon the love of lad
The love of lad
Some things gal says to lad
Aren't meant as bad but cause a little pain
They cause him pain
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
To take the house he built for her apart
To make it break
It's gonna take
A metal ball hung from a chain
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
To pick the broken ruins up again
To mend her heart
To help him start
To see a world apart from pain
Don't call me at work again
No, no, the boss still hates me
I'm just tired and I don't love you anymore
And there's a restaurant we should check out 
Where the other nightmare people like to go
I mean nice people—baby wait, I didn't mean to say nightmare
Lad looks at other gals
Gal thinks Jim Beam is handsomer than lad
He isn't bad
Call off the wedding band
Nobody wants to hear that one again
Play that again
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
To take the house he built for her apart
To make it break
It's gonna take
A metal ball hung from a chain
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
To pick the broken ruins up again
To mend her heart
To help him start
To see a world apart from pain
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane
They'll need a crane

He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
People should get beat up for stating their beliefs
He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
Because he knows there's no such thing
He asks a girl
If they can both sit in a chair
But he doesn't get nervous
She's not really there
He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
Because he knows there's no such thing
Tour the world
In a heavy metal band
But they run out of gas
The plane can never land
He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
People should get beat up for stating their beliefs
He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
Because he knows there's no such thing
What's the sense
In ever thinking about the tomb
When you're much too busy
Returning to the womb?
He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
People should get beat up for stating their beliefs
He wants a shoehorn, the kind with teeth
Because he knows there's no such thing

I like people, they're the ones who can't stand
They're the ones who can't stand
I see smoke signals coming from them
They say "We are out of furniture"
Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own
Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own
You made my day, now you have to sleep in it
Now you have to sleep in it
I love the world and if I have to sue for custody,
I will sue for custody
Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own
Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own
Stand on your own head
Stand on your own head for a change
Stand on your own head

Avalanche or roadblock
I was a snowball in hell
Avalanche or roadblock
A jailor trapped in his cell
Money's all broke, and food's going hungry
If it wasn't for disappointment
I wouldn't have any appointments
Side effect or drug trip
Don't tease me with all of your might
Side effect or drug trip
My panacea's in a Xerox shop
Have a nice day, you want it when?
Have a nice day, have a nice day
"I didn't expect to find a salesman drinking coffee this late in the morning.
How long you been here, Joe?"
"Oh, I don't know, I guess 30, 45 minutes maybe. Why do you ask?"
"You must be making a lot of sales, piling up a good income."
"Oh... uh... I'm doing all right.
I could do better, but... Ohahaha - I get it Paul.
Back on that old 'Time is Money' kick, right?"
"Not back on it, Joe, still on it."
Avalanche or roadblock
I was a snowball in hell
Avalanche or roadblock
A jailor trapped in his cell
Money I owe, money-iy-ay
Money I owe, money-iy-ay
Avalanche or roadblock
I was a snowball in hell
Yes, I was a snowball in hell
Yes, I was a snowball in hell

I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage
Called the blood of the exploited working class
But they've overcome their shyness
Now they're calling me Your Highness
And a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"
I destroyed a bond of friendship and respect
Between the only people left who'd even look me in the eye
Now I laugh and make a fortune
Off the same ones that I tortured
And a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"
I look like Jesus, so they say
But Mr. Jesus is very far away
Now you're the only one here who can tell me if it's true
That you love me and I love me
I built a little empire out of some crazy garbage
Called the blood of the exploited working class
But they've overcome their shyness
Now they're calling me Your Highness
And a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"
Yes a world screams, "Kiss me, Son of God"

Why is the world in love again?
Why are we marching hand-in-hand? 
Why are the ocean levels rising up?
It's a brand new record for 1990
They Might Be Giants' brand new album:

I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it:
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I have a secret to tell
From my electrical well
It's a simple message and
I'm leaving out the whistles and bells
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is blue canary
One note, spelled L-I-T-E
My story's infinite
Like the Longines Symphonette
It doesn't rest
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
I'm your only friend
I'm not your only friend
But I'm a little glowing friend
But really I'm not actually your friend
But I am
There's a picture opposite me
Of my primitive ancestry
Which stood on rocky shores
And kept the beaches shipwreck-free
Though I respect that a lot
I'd be fired if that were my job
After killing Jason off
And countless screaming Argonauts
Bluebird of friendliness
Like guardian angels it's
Always near
Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch
Who watches over you
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
While you're at it
Leave the nightlight on
Inside the birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
(Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch) While you're at it
(Who watches over you) Leave the nightlight on
(Make a little birdhouse in your soul) Inside the birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
(Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch) While you're at it
(Who watches over you) Leave the nightlight on
(Make a little birdhouse in your soul) Inside the birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet
Make a little birdhouse in your soul

I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on
She threw away her baby-doll
I held on to my pride
But I was young and foolish then
I feel old and foolish now
Confidentially
She never called me baby-doll
Confidentially
I never had much pride
But now I rock a bar stool
And I drink for two
Just pondering this time bomb in my mind
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on
She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
I could shake my tiny fist
And swear I wasn't wrong
But what's the sense in arguing
When you're all alone?
Sure as you can't steer a train
You can't change your fate
And when she told me off that day
I knew I'd lost my home
Confidentially
I never told you of her charms
Confidentially
We never had a home
But this railroad apartment
Was the perfect place
When she'd sit and hold me in her arms
I lost my lucky ball and chain
Now she's four years gone
Just five feet tall and sick of me
And all my rattling on
She walked away from a happy man
I thought I was so cool
I just stood there whistling
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door
"There goes the bride" as she walked out the door

Istanbul was Constantinople
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople
Been a long time gone, Constantinople
Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night 
(Oh) every gal in Constantinople
(Oh) lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople
(Oh) so if you've a date in Constantinople
(Oh) she'll be waiting in Istanbul
Even old New York
Was once New Amsterdam
Why they changed it I can't say
People just liked it better that way
So take me back to Constantinople
No, you can't go back to Constantinople
Been a long time gone, Constantinople
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks'
Doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo / ohhhhhhh ohh ohh ohh

I returned a bag of groceries
Accidentally taken off the shelf
Before the expiration date
I came back as a bag of groceries
Accidentally taken off the shelf
Before the date stamped on myself
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
Torches as my head fell in the basket, (large procession)
And was everybody dancing on the casket? (dance?)
Now it's over, I'm dead, and I haven't (now it's)
Done anything that I want (over)
Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
I will never say the word
"Procrastinate" again; I'll never
See myself in the mirror with my eyes closed
I didn't apologize
For when I was eight and I made my younger
Brother have to be my personal slave
Did a large procession wave their (did a)
Torches as my head fell in the basket, (large procession)
And was everybody dancing on the casket? (dance?)
Now it's over, I'm dead, and I haven't (now it's)

Or, I'm still alive and there's nothing I want to do
(So) So I won't
(Sit) Sit at home
(And) Anymore
(And) And you won't

This is where the party ends
I can't stand here listening to you
And your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
And your racist friend
It was the loveliest party that I've ever attended
If anything was broken I'm sure it could be mended
My head can't tolerate this bobbing and pretending
Listen to some bullet-head and the madness that he's saying
This is where the party ends
I'll just sit here wondering how you
Can stand by your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
You and your racist friend
This is where the party ends
I can't stand here listening to you
And your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
And your racist friend
Out from the kitchen to the bedroom to the hallway
Your friend apologizes, he could see it my way
He let the contents of the bottle do the thinking
Can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only kidding
This is where the party ends
I can't stand here listening to you
And your racist friend
I know politics bore you
But I feel like a hypocrite talking to you
And your racist friend

She set your goldfish free
And now she's sighing
Blew out your pilot light
And made a wish
She doesn't have to have
Her dB's records back now
But there's not a lot of things that
She'll take back
(She wants) She wants to see you again
(She wants) She wants to see you again
Slowly twistin' (Twistin'! [Twistin'!])
In the wind
(Twistin'!) Twistin' twistin' (Twistin'! [Twistin'!])
In the wind
She's not your satellite
She doesn't miss you
So turn off your smoke machine
And Marshall stack
She doesn't have to have
Her Young Fresh Fellows tape back now
But there's not a lot of things that
She'll take back
(She wants) She wants to see you again
(She wants) She wants to see you again
Slowly twistin' (Twistin'! [Twistin'!])

Where was I? I forgot
The point that I was making
I said if I was smart that I would
Save up for a piece of string
And a rock to wind the string around
Everybody wants a rock
To wind a piece of string around
Everybody wants a rock
To wind a piece of string around
Throw the crib door wide
Let the people crawl inside
Someone in this town
Is trying to burn the playhouse down
They want to stop the ones who want
A rock to wind a string around
But everybody wants a rock
To wind a piece of string around
Throw the crib door wide
Let the people crawl inside
Someone in this town
Is trying to burn the playhouse down
They want to stop the ones who want
A rock to wind a string around
But everybody wants a rock
To wind a piece of string around
If I were a carpenter I'd
Hammer on my piglet, I'd
Collect the seven dollars and I'd
Buy a big prosthetic forehead
And wear it on my real head
Everybody wants prosthetic
Foreheads on their real heads
Everybody wants prosthetic
Foreheads on their real heads
Throw the crib door wide
Let the people crawl inside
Someone in this town
Is trying to burn the playhouse down
They want to stop the ones who want
Prosthetic foreheads on their heads
But everybody wants prosthetic
Foreheads on their real heads
Throw the crib door wide
Let the people crawl inside
Someone in this town
Is trying to burn the foreheads down
They want to stop the ones who want
A rock to wind a string around
But everybody wants a rock
To wind a piece of string around

Mr. Horrible
Mr. Horrible
Telephone call for Mr. Horrible
But before he can talk to the ugliness men
There's some horrible business left
For him to attend to
Something unpleasant has spilled on his brain
As he sponges it off they say
"Is this Horrible?
Is this Horrible?
It's the ugliness men, Mr. Horrible
We're just trying to bug you
We thought that our dreadfulness
Might be a thing to annoy you with"
But Mr. Horrible says, "I don't mind
The thing that bothers me is
Someone keeps moving my chair"
"Would you mind if we balance this glass of milk
Where your visiting friend accidentally was killed?
Would it be okay with you if we wrote a reminder
Of things we'll forget to do today otherwise,
Using a green Magic Marker, if it's alright
On the back of your head?"
Mr. Horrible
Mr. Horrible
We're not done with you yet Mr. Horrible
You have to try on these pants so the Ugliness Men
Can decide if they're just as embarrassing as we think
We have to be sure about this
But Mr. Horrible says, "I don't mind
The thing that bothers me is
Someone keeps moving my chair"
Someone keeps moving my chair
Mr. Horrible says, "I don't mind
The thing that bothers me is
Someone keeps moving my chair"

Backwards:
Your mercy
Your mercy
Frosty the supervisor
Lives by himself
Sometimes I feel sorry for him
Usually I can't
I've turned off my hearing aid
Don't say the electric chair's not good enough
For king-lazy-bones like myself
More coffee for me, boss
'Cause I'm not as messed up as I want to be
I've turned off my hearing aid
Don't say the electric chair's not good enough
For king-lazy-bones like myself

Minimum Wage!  HYAH!

I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O
If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time
You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about
When you took a bite out of my spine
I would have a lot of eyes on me by this time, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't that just be fine?
Too late or soon to make noise about love and there's no time for sorrow
Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow
I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow
'Cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know
She's my best friend, she's a sparrow
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know
When you know what you are, O

A woman came up to me and said
"I'd like to poison your mind
With wrong ideas that appeal to you
Though I am not unkind"
She looked at me, I looked at something
Written across her scalp
And these are the words that it faintly said
As I tried to call for help:
There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do
What you know how to do well
And that's be you
Be what you're like
Be like yourself
And so I'm having a wonderful time
But I'd rather be whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
There's only one thing that I like
And that is whistling in the dark
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
A man came up to me and said
"I'd like to change your mind
By hitting it with a rock," he said
"Though I am not unkind."
We laughed at his little joke
And then I happily walked away
And hit my head on the wall of the jail
Where the two of us live today
There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do
What you know how to do well
And that's be you
Be what you're like
Be like yourself
And so I'm having a wonderful time
But I'd rather be whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
There's only one thing that I like
And that is whistling in the dark
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
There's only one thing that I know how to do well
And I've often been told that you only can do

Be what you're like
Be like yourself
And so I'm having a wonderful time
But I'd rather be whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling in the dark
Whistling, whistling
Whistling in the dark
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So Hot Cha, where are you?
First time Hot Cha went away
A floating island was his home
Then the phone rang off the hook
And Hot Cha had to come back home
Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So Hot Cha, where are you?
Second time he went away
Left the bathtub running over
Stereo on and cooking bacon
Never came back to tell us why
If that honey would come back
We would throw such a party
Drink and cook the prodigal son
Fondue forks for everybody
Hot Cha, where are you?
Everybody's eyes are closed
I can't see why I miss you so
So Hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?
Hot Cha, where are you?

When the ship runs out of ocean
And the vessel runs aground
Land's where we know the boat is found
Now there's nothing unexpected
About the water giving out
"Land"'s not a word we have to shout
But there's something beside the shoreline
Moving across the beachhead
Coming up from the shipwreck
Making as if to say
Women and Men
Women and Men
Women and Men
Women and Men
(Women and Men) Bringing with them messages of love
And every where they go love will grow (love will grow)
(Women and Men) When you see the faces of the women
And the men, you too will know (you will know)
Women and Men have crossed the ocean
They now begin to pour
Out from the boat and up the shore
Two by two they enter the jungle
And soon they number more
Three by three as well as four by four
Soon the stream of people gets wider
Then it becomes a river
River becomes an ocean
Carrying ships that bear
Women and Men
Women and Men
Women and Men
Women and Men

Pistol shots
Gun shots
Pistol shots
Gun shots
Bullets from a revolver
Bullets from a gun
Bullets through the atmosphere
Here they come
John, I've been bad
And they're coming after me
Done someone wrong
And I fear that it was me
Sapphire bullets
Bullets of pure love
Sapphire bullets
Bullets of pure love

So that everyone needs to hang on tighter
just to keep from being thrown to the wolves."

We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of bourbon
And we'll go
We were once so close to heaven
Peter came out and gave us medals
Declaring us the nicest of the damned
Time won't find the lost
It'll sweep up our skeleton bones
So take the wheel and I will take the pedals
We're in a road movie to Berlin
Can't drive out the way we drove in
So sneak out this glass of bourbon
And we'll go

Dig my grave
Dig my grave
Every time I look in your eyes
I see St. Peter wave
Dig my grave
Dig my grave
Every time you call my name
I hear the angels say
Dig my grave
Dig my grave
Dig my grave
Dig my grave
Dig my grave

"We take you to Brooklyn."
Words fail
Buildings tumble
The ground opens wide
Light beams down from heaven
She stands before my eyes
She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror
But they're actual size
As she drives away
Big men
Often tremble
As they step aside
I thought I was big once
She changed my mind
She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me (Size!)
I've never known anybody like her
She's actual size
Nationwide, believe
She's got
All the money
Money couldn't buy
She's got something special
That someone left behind
She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me
Squares may look distant in her rear view mirror
But they're actual size
Actual size to her
Her face
Hangs in portrait
On the post office wall
She's stuck in my heart now
Where my blood belongs
She's actual size, but she seems much bigger to me (Size!)
I've never known anybody like her
She's actual size
Actual size, believe

My evil twin 
Bad weather friend
He always wants to start when 
I want to begin
It scares me so 
Like I scare myself
With that book of Nostradamus 
Up upon my shelf
Playing hangman till the morning light
Doing donuts on the neighbor's lawn
Then sleep all through the day
Get up and start again
I can hear some sirens somewhere 
But I don't know why
My evil twin 
Runs home again
Search lights look for an alibi, but
I'll be home by then
Here he comes again 
My evil twin
My friends have seen him hiding 
Underneath my skin
Who cut the arm off the voodoo doll
That resembles a Republican president from long ago
I'd hate to see you leave
'Cause I have grown so grateful for the
Blame you save me from
My twin
My twin
My twin
(My twin) I know he looks like me
(My twin) Hates work like me and walks like me
(My twin) He's even got a twin like me
My evil twin 
Bad weather friend
I know some day I'll meet him
But I don't know where or when

Glass of milk
Standing in between extinction in the cold
And explosive radiating growth
So the warm blood flows
Through the large four-chambered heart
Maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have
Mammal, mammal (Mammal, mammal)
Their names are called
They raise a paw
The bat, the cat
Dolphin and dog (Mammal)
Koala bear and hog (Mammal)
One of us might lose his hair
But you're reminded that it once was there
From the embryonic whale to the monkey with no tail
So the warm blood flows
With the red blood cells lacking nuclei
Through the large four-chambered heart
Maintaining the very high metabolism rate they have
Mammal, mammal (Mammal, mammal)
Their names are called
They raise a paw
The bat, the cat

The statue got me high (high)
The statue got me high (high)
The monument of granite sent a beam into my eye
The statue made me die (die)
The statue made me die (die)
It took my hand, it killed me, and it turned me to the sky
The stone, it called to me 
(and now I see the things the stone has shown to me)
A rock that spoke a word 
(an animated mineral, it can be heard)
And though I once preferred a human being's company
They pale before the monolith that towers over me
The statue got me high (high)
The statue got me high (high)
The truth is where the sculptor's chisel chipped away the lie
The statue made me fry (fry)
The statue made me fry (fry)
My coat contained a furnace where there used to be a guy
The stone, it called to me 
(and now I see the things the stone has shown to me)
A rock that spoke a word 
(an animated mineral, it can be heard)
And as the screaming fire engine siren filled the air
The evidence had vanished from my charred and smoking chair
And what they found was just a statue standing where the statue got me high
And what they found was just a statue standing where the statue got me high
And now it is your turn 
(your turn to hear the stone and then your turn to burn)
The stone, it calls to you 
(you can't refuse to do the things it tells you to)
And as the screaming fire engine siren fills the air
The evidence will vanish from your charred and smoking chair
And what they found was just a statue standing where the statue got me high
And what they'll find is just a statue standing where the statue got you high

I don't want to change your mind
I don't want to think about your mind
They say love is blind
I don't think you're blind
You don't want to understand
I don't want to shake your father's hand
And walk in the sand
And act like a man
I get on the bus
Ride past our stop
And though I'm late
I can't get off
I just can't bear to tell you some lies
And narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
We'll take back every thing we said
Split up all the things and move ahead
Forgot how you said
We'll split the side off the bed
I get on my bike
Ride down our block
Ride through the world
Through the green lights
But when I think of all your advice
I narrow my eyes
Narrow my eyes
I don't want to change your mind
I don't want to think about your mind
They say love is blind
I don't think you're blind
I get on the bus
Ride past our stop
And though I'm late
I can't get off
I just can't bear to tell you some lies
And narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Now let's toast the sad cold fact
Our love's never coming back
And we'll race to the bottom of a glass
So narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes
Narrow your eyes

Here in the hall of heads
You look through the keyhole
This is the hall of heads
One step through the doorway
Roll out that special head
This is our favorite one
Please don't try to leave
Don't leave the hall of heads
Hide underneath the porch
Hide down behind the furnace
You can't get away
You can't really hide
Once you hear the call
The song of the hall of heads
You can't run away
Your feet won't help you run
You can't run away
Out of the hall of heads


Which describes how you're feeling all the time
Which describes how you're feeling all the
Feeling all the time
There's this guy in the sky and he makes you want to
Want to make you sigh, like the time
When you felt like you're feeling all the time
And you sighed at the cracks in the ceiling all the time
You said "I'm feeling fine" but it didn't really rhyme
It didn't rhyme, overseas
Which describes how you're feeling all the time
It describes how you're feeling
Which describes how you're feeling all the time
When you lie that your life's unappealing all the time
But your lie doesn't rhyme with the word overseas
Overseas there's this guy
Who describes how you're feeling all the time
In his mind he can find how you're feeling all the time
From behind distant lines
Even straighter than his spine
Which is fine
Which is fine
And describes how you're feeling all the time

I lay my head
On the railroad track
Stare at the sky
All painted up
Your train is gone, won't be coming back
See the constellation ride across the sky
No cigar, no lady on his arm
Just a guy made of dots and lines
Just a guy made of dots and lines
Two years ago
Moved from my town
I was looking up
Past the city lights
But the city lights got in my way
See the constellation ride across the sky
No cigar, no lady on his arm
Just a guy made of dots and lines
Just a guy made of dots and lines
I found my mind
On the ground below
I was looking down
It was looking back
I was in the sky, all dressed in black
See the constellation ride across the sky
No cigar, no lady on his arm
Just a guy made of dots and lines
Just a guy made of dots and lines
Just a guy made of dots and lines
Can you hear what I see in the sky?
Can you hear what I see in the sky?
Can you hear what I see in the sky?

If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy
I'd burn all the uniforms
I'd burn all the "Ask Me" buttons
I'd burn all the intercoms
I'd burn all the time clock cards
If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy
I'd steal somebody's Cadillac
I'd steal anything I lack
I'd steal all the microphones
From all the masters of ceremony
If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy
I'd ask you, if you don't mind
To kiss you a hundred times
If I wasn't shy
If I wasn't shy

I was working all night in my office
When a man I had recently killed
Called me up from a phone near my building
So I looked out the window at him
He had the same obsequious manner
That was the reason I had him killed
So to calm my nerves I sang this song
To him, over the phone
Turn around, turn around
There's a thing there that can be found
Turn around, turn around
It's a human skull on the ground
Human skull on the ground
Turn around
I was out by myself in the graveyard
I was doing an interpretive dance
When I felt something heavy and pointed
Strike me in the back of my neck
And then the ghost of my dance instructor
Pushed me down into an open grave
And as dirt rained down she played a xylophone
And sang me this song
Turn around, turn around
There's a thing there that can be found
Turn around, turn around
It's a human skull on the ground
Human skull on the ground
Turn around
We were waving our arms out the window
Of a fast moving passenger train
Acting in an irresponsible fashion
Until the engineer whose back had been turned
And who we thought would find us highly amusing
Quickly swiveled his head around
And his face which was a paper-white mask of evil
Sang us this song
Turn around, (round) turn around (round)
There's a thing there that can be found (there's a thing there that can be)
Turn around, (found) turn around (round)
It's a human skull on the ground (it's a human skull on the)
Human skull (ground) on the ground (round)
Turn around (turn around, turn around)
Turn around, (round) turn around (round)
There's a thing there that can be found (there's a thing there that can be)
Turn around, (found) turn around (round)
It's a human skull on the ground (it's a human skull on the)
Human skull (ground) on the ground (round)
Turn around (turn around, turn around)

What's that blue thing doing here?

Something grabbed a hold of my hand
I didn't know what had my hand
But that's when all my troubles began

I don't understand you (I don't understand you)
I just don't understand you (I don't understand you)
I don't understand the things you say
I can't understand a single word
I don't understand you (I don't understand you)
I just don't understand you (I don't understand you)
I cannot understand you (I don't understand you)
I don't understand you (I don't understand you)

I heard a sound
I turned around
Turned around to find the thing that made the sound

Mysterious whisper

The day that love came to play

I'm having a heart attack

I'm having a heart attack

Sir hand
Or is it ma'am?
I fell out of my right place again
And you
Considered me
And now I'm where a snail has to be
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Was it something you would do for anybody?
Was it what you'd only do for me? 
I need to know because you see
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Friend
Look what you gave
And how can you ever be repaid?
How may I give you a hand
From the position at your feet where I stand?
So let me thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
I'd like to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Was it something you would do for anybody?
Was it what you'd only do for me? 
I need to know because you see
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Snail shell
Thank you
Snail shell
Thank you
Was it something you would do for anybody?
Was it what you'd only do for me? 
Or was it something where you acted when you saw the need 
And knew that there would be a way the act could be repaid? 
And so it may, but for today, I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell

I got a crush
Copy shop clerk
But she won't look up at me
Don't want to be known as the freak
Who just comes around to catch her eye
We could be sleeping in the flowers
We could sleep all afternoon
You'd proclaim that you're an island
I'd proclaim that I'm one too
Then we float into the harbor
With just piers and boats around
I declare that I am England
You declare that I have drowned
I got a ride
Home with a drunk guy
How ungrateful I must have seemed
He showed me how
To spin my head round and round
We could be sleeping in the flowers
We could sleep all afternoon
You'd proclaim that you're an island
I'd proclaim that I'm one too
Then we float into the harbor
With just piers and boats around
I declare that I am England
You declare that I have drowned
We could be sleeping in the flowers
We could sleep all afternoon
You'd proclaim that you're an island
I'd proclaim that I'm one too
Then we float into the harbor
With just piers and boats around
I declare that I am England
You declare that I have drowned
We'll be sleeping in the flowers
Tell my boss that I've been fired
We'll be sleeping in the flowers
Tell my boss that I've been fired
We'll be sleeping in the flowers
Tell my boss I'm fired
We'll be sleeping in the flowers
Tell my boss I'm fired

"Do you smile 'cause I'm funny?" said the man
"I wasn't joking and I meant the thing I said"
"Not at all, not at all"
Said the woman to the man
"I was thinking of an unrelated thing"
Unconnected and free
No relationship to anything
"How come you never look me in the eye?
Aren't you listening to me?" said the man
"Not at all, not at all"
Said the woman to the man
"I'm still thinking of an unrelated thing"
Somewhere other than here
Something else besides the man
"Please explain the expression on your face
Then I'll know what's beneath it," said the man
"No you won't, no you won't"
Said the woman to the man
"I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing
I'll be thinking of an unrelated thing"

It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
We can't fly like birds in
The air
We could walk but we'd never
Get there
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
Big hand's on one-twenty
Little hand's on E
Hey, NyQuil driver
It's NyQuil driving time
Hey, NyQuil driver
Get outta my lane, get outta my way
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
Hey, NyQuil driver
It's NyQuil driving time
Hey, NyQuil driver
Get outta my lane, Get outta my way
Get outta my way
Hey, NyQuil driver
It's NyQuil driving time
Hey NyQuil driver
Get outta my lane, get outta my way
Get outta my way
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away
It's just a full day's drive away

I saw the best minds of my generation
Destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical
I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
If, by random whim, one occurs to me
If necessary, leave paper stains on the gray utility pole
I saw the worst bands of my generation
Applied by magic marker to dry wall
I should be allowed to shoot my mouth off
I should have a call-in show
I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
If by random whim, one occurs to me
If necessary, leave paper stains on the gray utility pole
I am not allowed
To ever come up with a single original thought
I am not allowed
To meet the criminal government agent who oppresses me
I was the worst hope of my generation
Destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical
I should be allowed to share my feelings
I should be allowed to feel
I should be allowed to glue my poster
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
I should be allowed to think
And I should be allowed to blurt the merest idea
If by random whim, one occurs to me
But sadly, this can never be
I am not allowed to think
I am not allowed to think
I am not allowed to think (I am not allowed to think)
I am not allowed to think (I am not allowed to think)
I am not allowed to think (I am not allowed to think)
I am not allowed to think (I am not allowed to think)

When I walk down the street, most guys look like elves
I don't mean to put them down but they do
It's hard to understand me from the language I use
There's no word in English for my style
What's a man like me supposed to do
With all this extra savoir-faire?
What is left for me to prove, dear?
I know just what to do when the ladies come 'round
You can try to copy me but you'll fail
Now, you might think you're different but time will prove me right
When you wake up from your dream I'll be gone
What's a man like me supposed to do
With all this extra savoir-faire?
What is left for me to prove, dear?

"No More Mister Nice Guy"
"I Love the Dead"
I've been thinking about it
Now I understand what he said
Ask me now
I understand the words that Alice said
I kick the rocks beneath me
I squint at the sun
Sad, sad, sad, sad
Why must I be sad?
The rows of dandelions growing all around me
Why must I be sad? (sad, sad, sad)
(sad, sad, sad)
No one knows these things but me and him
So I'm writing everything down in a spiral notebook
In the hopes that some day
Other people will feel as low as this
Ask me now
I understand the words that Alice said
I kick the rocks beneath me
I squint at the sun
Sad, sad, sad, sad
Why must I be sad?
The rows of dandelions growing all around me
Why must I be sad? (sad, sad, sad)
"No More Mister Nice Guy"
"I Love the Dead"
I've been thinking about it

I kick the rocks beneath me
I squint at the sun
Sad, sad, sad, sad
Why must I be sad?
The rows of dandelions growing all around me
Why must I be sad? ("Welcome to My Nightmare" / "Dead)
Why must I be sad? (Babies" / "Raped and Freezing" / "You)
Why must I be sad? (Drive Me Nervous" / "Elected" /)
Why must I be sad? ("Generation Landslide" / "Un-)
Why must I be sad? (der My Wheels" / "Muscle of Love" /)
Why must I be sad? ("School's Out" / "Only Women Bleed" /)
Why must I be sad? ("Billion Dollar Babies")
Why must I be sad? (sad, sad, sad)

I see you from my spy plane, baby
I see you walking on the ground
I see you through my spy glasses, baby
I can see right through the ground
If you want to be a spy
Then you must really see
And you must really see
If you want to be a spy like me
Come on
I might gaze on a submarine
I see your face smiling at me
Even when I close my eyes
Your silhouette is smiling at me
But you will never understand me
Because I have a special job
I wish I could break the spy glass
Set it free
So we could be
Spy spy spy spy
Spy spy spy spy
Spy spy spy spy
Spy spy spy spy
Spy

O, do not forsake me, my indolent friends
O, do not forsake me though you know I must spend
All my darkest hours talking like this
For I am one thousand years old
One thousand years old
Sure, you think that's old
One thousand years old
But what do you know?
In my darkest hour I'm talking like this
For I am one thousand years old
Oh, some have forgotten the flower of speech
And walks through the garden where I go to defend
Misbegotten notions while talking like this (Misbegotten notions)
For I am one thousand years old
One thousand years old (One thousand years old)
Sure, I'd say that's old (So old)
One thousand years old (Real old)
But what do I know? (You know that)
In your darkest hour, my indolent friends
We'll be one thousand years old

In my prison cell I think these words
I was careless
I can see that now
I must be silent
Must contain my secret smile
I want to tell you
You my mirror
You my iron bars
When I made a shadow on my window shade
They called the police and testified
But they're like the people chained up in the cave
In the allegory of the people in the cave by the Greek guy
No one understands
No one knows my plan
Why the dancing, shouting
Why the shrieks of pain
The lovely music
Why the smell of burning autumn leaves
No one understands
No one knows my plan
Why the dancing, shouting
Why the shrieks of pain
The lovely music
Why the smell of burning autumn leaves
In my prison cell I bide my time
Always thinking
Always busy cooking up an angle
Working on the tiny blueprint of the angle
Sketching out the burning autumn leaves
No one understands
No one knows my plan
I must be silent, must contain my secret smile
I want to tell you
You my mirror
You my iron bars
No one understands
No one knows my plan

Here comes the dirt bike
Beware of the dirt bike
Because I hear they're coming to our town
They've got plans for everyone
And now I hear they're over their sophomore jinx
So you had better check it out
All hail the dirt bike
Philosopher dirt bike
Silence as we gathered round
We saw the word and we're on our way
Now it's brain-washing dirt bike
Ground-shaking dirt bike
Mind-bending dirt bike
In control
Soul-crushing dirt bike
Self-propelled dirt bike
You see I never thought I'd understand
Till that bike took me by the hand
Now I ride
Ride
Ride

Don't bother to call this room
There's nobody here who can pick up
Or has stuff they need to talk about
And who won't be now checking out and flying
By rocket to the moon
By airplane to the rocket
By taxi to the airport
By front door to the taxi
By throwing back the blanket, hanging down the legs
Thank you for the card with the cartoon nurse
But you see there's nothing wrong with me
You think, "That's what you think
That's what they all say"
Before I blow you away
By rocket to the moon
By airplane to the rocket
By taxi to the airport
By front door to the taxi
By throwing back the blanket, hanging down the legs
Soon the man who sweeps the room
Brings the secret telegram
"COMMENCE OFFICIAL INTERPLANETARY EXPLORATION"
Thank you for the card with the cartoon nurse
But you see there's nothing wrong with me
You think, "That's what you think
That's what they all say"
Before I blow you away
By rocket to the moon
By airplane to the rocket
By taxi to the airport
By front door to the taxi
By throwing back the blanket, hanging down the legs
By rocket to the moon
Crawl to the rocket
By coughing at the airport
By limping to the taxi
By throwing back the blanket, hanging down the withered leg

I'm sitting on the curb
Of the empty parking lot
Of the store where they let me play the organ
I'm waiting for my ride
But I want to wait inside
The store where they let me play the organ
But I'm thinking of a wooden chair
In the room at the top of the stair
And I'm looking down the stairwell
At the vanishing dot
On the map of the spot
Let me take you there
The dotted line
Surrounding the mind
Of a self called nowhere
It's a thing named "it*"
In a bottomless pit
You can't see it there
The sunken head
That lies in the bed
Of a self called nowhere
Standing in my yard
Where they tore down the garage
To make room for the torn down garage
I'm looking for my car
But I must have sold my car
When I needed to buy an electric organ
But I'm thinking of a wooden chair
In the room at the top of the stair
And I'm looking down the stairwell
At the vanishing dot
On the map of the spot
Let me take you there
The dotted line
Surrounding the mind
Of a self called nowhere
It's a thing named "it*"
In a bottomless pit
You can't see it there
The sunken head
That lies in the bed
Of a self called nowhere
Nowhere
The vanishing dot
On the map of the spot
Let me take you there
The dotted line
Surrounding the mind
Of a self called nowhere
It's a thing named "it*"
In a bottomless pit
You can't see it there
The sunken head
That lies in the bed
Of a self called...

Meet James Ensor
Belgium's famous painter
Dig him up and shake his hand
Appreciate the man
Before there were junk stores
Before there was junk
He lived with his mother and the torments of Christ
The world was transformed
A crowd gathered round
Pressed against his window so they could be the first
To meet James Ensor
Belgium's famous painter
Raise a glass and sit and stare
Understand the man
He lost all his friends
He didn't need his friends
He lived with his mother and repeated himself
The world has forgotten
The world moved along
The crowd at his window went back to their homes
Meet James Ensor
Meet James Ensor
Belgium's famous painter
Dig him up and shake his hand
Appreciate the man

When the hands that operate the motor lose control of the lever
When the mind of its own in the wheel puts two and two together
When the indicator says you're out of oil
Should you continue driving anyway?
There's a thermostat that regulates the temperature
That might not be reliable
That should be disconnected
Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down
As I was just saying
As I was just saying
As I was just telling you a minute ago
I was just talking and someone interrupted
Or was it a loud explosion?
Or is the thermostat engulfed in flames
Or is it just me?
Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down
As I was just saying
As I was just saying
As I was just saying
Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down
Turn it up when the cold brings you down
When the heat bothers you turn it down
Turn it up, turn it down

Look at all the people in the window
I'm checking out the people in the window
I was uncomfortable
Now I'm uncomfortable
The trouble I encountered when I thought it was, it was a window
It was a catalog
Of many women, men
The window
Window
Window
Look at all the people in the window
I'm checking out the people in the window
I was uncomfortable
Now I'm uncomfortable
The trouble I encountered when I thought it was, it was a window

Long before the screen door slammed
She was out of Xenia
A stranger could have loved that town
But she had to leave
I wish I'd gotten to know her
Before I fell in love
I could say who's to blame
Say who's the man
In this cautionary tale
But I swore I'd be true
And I'll swear and I'll swear
'Til Kitten's out of jail
It was like a TV show
The way she stole that car
Easy now to criticize
Easy now to talk
I thought my luck was changing
I guess I was wrong
I could say who's to blame
Say who's the man 
In this cautionary tale
But I swore I'd be true
And I'll swear and I'll swear
'Til Kitten's out of jail
Didn't want to be a slave
Just turned out that way
I wish I'd gotten to know her
Before I fell in love
I could say she's to blame
Say she's the man
In this cautionary tale
But I swore I'd be true
And I'll swear and I'll swear
'Til Kitten's out of jail

Stomp Box speak my thought
Vent these voices from the dark
Shout Shout Shout Shout
Scream it out
Blast your missive
Tell the wordless message
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart
Stomp Box, voice of fear
Pour the poison in my ear
Kill Kill Kill Kill
Kill me now
Free the demon
Hear the ceaseless screaming
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart
Stomp Box speak my thought
Vent these voices from the dark
Shout Shout Shout Shout
Scream it out
Blast your missive
Tell the wordless message
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart
Kill Kill Kill Kill
Kill me now
Free the demon
Hear the ceaseless screaming
Little Stomp Box
Tear it from my heart
Yeah!

There's a girl with a crown and a scepter
Who's on WLSD
And she says that the scene isn't what it's been
And she's thinking of going home
That it's old and it's totally over now
And it's old and it's over, it's over now
And it's over, it's over, it's over now
I can see myself
At the end of the tour
When the road disappears
If there's any more people around
When the tour runs aground
And if you're still around
Then we'll meet at the end of the tour
The engagements are booked through the end of the world
So we'll meet at the end of the tour
Never to part since the day we met
Out on Interstate 91
I was bent metal, you were a flaming wreck
When we kissed at the overpass
I was sailing along with the people
Driving themselves to distraction inside me
Then came a knock on the door which was odd
And the picture abruptly changed
At the end of the tour
When the road disappears
If there's any more people around
When the tour runs aground
And if you're still around
Then we'll meet at the end of the tour
The engagements are booked through the end of the world
So we'll meet at the end of the tour
This was the vehicle; these were the people
You opened the door and expelled all the people
This was the vehicle; these were the people
You opened the door and expelled all the people
This was the vehicle; these were the people
You let them go
At the end of the tour
When the road disappears
If there's any more people around
When the tour runs aground
And if you're still around
Then we'll meet at the end of the tour
The engagements are booked through the end of the world
So we'll meet at the end of the tour
And we're never gonna tour again
No, we're never gonna tour again

The token back to Brooklyn fell between the grating
And we're just watching it sinking
The fare went up to one hundred dollars
And we can never go home again
The bill collector's drinking lighter fluid
And says he'll tell our parents
Our feet start running at a furious pace
But we can't get away

Dressed only in clothes
From her head to her toes
This is the way
The talking part goes
S-E-X-X-Y
More than enough
Around the clock with nobody else
S-E-X-X-Y
There she is
Standing on the bed
Cookie in one hand, wig on her head
S-E-X-X-Y
X because it's extra baby
Y because it's extra baby
Unnoticed by few
Very very few
And that includes you
Look inside your mind
Look inside your eye
Secret agent spy, come to see why
S-E-X-X-Y
One finger nail
Across your back
Baby's first gold tooth initials inscribed
S-E-X-X-Y
X because it's extra baby
Y because it's extra baby
You gotta understand
She wants to be your man
She's got another plan

There were eighty-seven Advil in the bottle now there's thirty left
I ate forty-seven so what happened to the other ten?
Why do you suspiciously change the subject and break my concentration
As I dump the bottle out and I count the Advil up again?
Don't interrupt me as I struggle to complete this thought
Have some respect for someone more forgetful than yourself
And I'm not done
And I won't be till my head falls off
Hitting every pocket on my shirt, pants and overcoat
And I'm hitting them again but I don't know where I put my notes
Clearing my throat, and gripping the lectern I smile and face my audience
Clearing his throat and smiling with his hands on the bathroom sink
And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall
I see stuff through the glass that I don't recognize at all
And I'm not done
And I won't be till my head falls off
Though it may not be a long way off
I'm not done talking yet
I'm not done talking yet
And when I lean my head against the frosted shower stall
I see a broken figure silhouetted on the wall
And I'm not done
And I won't be till my head falls off
Though it may not be a long way off
I won't be done until my head falls off

Birds are calling to sing along
But my window's painted shut
And all that year of chorus taught me
Is out of style and long forgot
How can I sing like a girl
And not be stigmatized
By the rest of the world?
Tell me, how can I sing like a girl
And not be objectified
As if I were a girl?
I want to raise my freak flag
Higher and higher and
I want to raise my freak flag
And never be alone
Never be alone
From the watchtowers I've been spotted
Fingers pointing at my mouth
Spotlights turn and pivot towards me
But I dare not make a sound
How can I sing like a girl
And not be stigmatized
By the rest of the world?
Tell me, how can I sing like a girl
And not be objectified
As if I were a girl?
I want to raise my freak flag
Higher and higher and
I want to raise my freak flag
And never be alone
Never be alone
How can I sing like a girl
And not be stigmatized
By the rest of the world?
Tell me, how can I sing like a girl
And not be objectified
As if I were a girl?
How can I sing like a girl?
How can I sing like a girl?
How can I sing like a girl?
How can I sing like a girl?

Down at the shore there's a place 
Where there's no one vacationing
There's just the sound of the call 
Of the wild overcoming 
The fear of the unknown
And I've got something 
To help you understand
Something waiting there 
Beneath the sand
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time
I'm the inspector over the mine
Look past the volleyball (look past the ball)
Look past the squawking gull (look past the gull)
Ignore the mountain of discarded folderol
'Cause I've got something 
To make you understand
Something hidden there 
Underneath the land
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time
I'm the inspector over the mine
Metal detector, watch it shine
Every seashell has a story to tell 
If you're listening
But underneath every shell there's a story as well
If you've heard enough of the sea
Then everything on the top 
Will just suddenly stop seeming interesting
So listen now to the sound 
Of the things that are found underground
Don't need no volleyball (don't need no volleyball)
Don't need no squawking gull (don't need no squawking gull)
Don't need to look at any bathing beauty doll (don't need to look at any doll)
For I've got something 
To help you understand
Something waiting there 
Beneath the sand
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time
I'm the inspector over the mine
Look past the volleyball (look past the ball)
Look past the squawking gull (look past the gull)
Ignore the mountain of discarded folderol
'Cause I've got something 
To make you understand
Something hidden there 
Underneath the land
My metal detector
Is with me all of the time
I'm the inspector over the mine
Metal detector, watch it shine
Don't need no volleyball (don't need no volleyball)
Don't need no squawking gull (don't need no squawking gull)
Metal detector, all the time (metal detector all the time)

You called me last night on the telephone
And I was glad to hear from you 'cause I was all alone
You said, "It's snowing, it's snowing! God, I hate this weather!"
Now I walk through blizzards just to get us back together
We met in the springtime at a rock-and-roll show
It was on the Bowery when it was time to go
We kissed on the subway in the middle of the night
I held your hand, you held mine, it was the best night of my life
'Cause everyone's your friend in New York City
And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
But the best thing about New York City is you and me
The Statue of Liberty, Staten Island Ferry, Co-op City, Katz's and Tiffany's
Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State where Dylan lived
Coney Island and Times Square, Rockefeller Center
Wish I was there
You wrote me a letter just the other day
It said, "Springtime is coming soon so why don't you come to stay?"
I packed my stuff, it's on the bus, I can't believe it's true
I'm three days from New York City and I'm three days from you
'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City
And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
But the best thing about New York City is you and me
'Cause everyone's my friend in New York City
And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
But the best thing about New York City is you and me

It's your own worst enemy
Ringing the bell on the door
And the person inside says nobody's home
So your own worst enemy peeks inside
And sees you softly weeping as some music fills the room
And the song they play
Is that guy with the messed up face
Going, "Precious and few are the moments that you
And your own worst enemy share."
Full bottle in front of me
Time to roll up my sleeves
And get to work
And after many glasses of work
I get paid in the brain
And the song they play
Is that guy with the messed up face
Going, "Precious and few are the moments that you
And your own worst enemy share."
And the song they play
Is that guy with the messed up face
Going, "Precious and few are the moments that you
And your own worst enemy share."
It's your own worst enemy

XTC versus Adam Ant
Content versus form
Fighting for their place in rock and roll
There is no right or wrong
Just when you think it's finished
With XTC on top
Ant music, like a phoenix
Flies back up the charts
XTC versus Adam Ant
Only one will survive
Beatle-based pop versus new romantic
History will decide
XTC versus Adam Ant
I can't tell you why
Even the singer from Bow Wow Wow
Can't make up her mind
XTC versus Adam Ant
Time is marching on
XTC versus Adam Ant
There is no right or wrong
There is no right or wrong
There is
No right
Or wrong

Down, down, down you go
No way to stop
As you fall, hear me call
No, no, no
Listen to this warning and
Consider these
Simple words of advice
Stop, stop, stop
Fogging the view, cupping face to the window
In darkness you make out a spiraling shape
Putting all reason aside you exchange
What you've got for a thing that's hypnotic and strange
The spiraling shape will make you go insane
(Everyone wants to see that groovy thing)
But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
(Everyone wants to see that thing)
And nobody knows what it's really like
But everyone says it's great
And they heard it from the spiral in their eyes
This could lead to excellence
Or serious injury
Only one way to know
Go, go, go
Go ahead, wreck your life
That might be good
Who can say what's wrong or right?
Nobody can
Put out your hands and you fall through the window
And clawing at nothing you drop through the void
Your terrified screams are inaudible drowned
In the spiral ahead and consumed in the shape
The spiraling shape will make you go insane
(Everyone wants to see that groovy thing)
But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
(Everyone wants to see that thing)
And now that you've tried it, you're back to report
That the spiraling shape was a fraud and a fake
You didn't enjoy it, you never believed it
There won't be a refund, you'll never go back
The spiraling shape will make you go insane
(Everyone wants to see that groovy thing)
But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
(Everyone wants to see that thing)
And nobody knows what it's really like
But everyone says it's great
And they heard it from the spiral in their eyes
(Spiral in their eyes)
Fogging the view, cupping face to the window
In darkness you make out a spiraling shape
Putting all reason aside you exchange
What you got for a thing that's hypnotic and strange
The spiraling shape will make you go insane
(Everyone wants to see that groovy thing)
But everyone wants to see that groovy thing
(Everyone wants to see that thing)
Don't spend the rest of your life wondering
(Everyone wants to see that thing)
Don't spend the rest of your life wondering
(Everyone wants to see that groovy thing)
Don't spend the rest of your life wondering
(Everyone wants to see that thing)

In 1844, the Democrats were split
The three nominees for the presidential candidate
Were Martin Van Buren, a former president and an abolitionist
James Buchanan, a moderate
Lewis Cass, a general and expansionist
From Nashville came a dark horse riding up
He was James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump
Austere, severe, he held few people dear
His oratory filled his foes with fear
The factions soon agreed
He's just the man we need
To bring about victory
Fulfill our manifest destiny
And annex the land the Mexicans command
And when the poll was cast, the winner was
Mister James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump
In four short years he met his every goal
He seized the whole Southwest from Mexico
Made sure the tariffs fell
And made the English sell the Oregon Territory
He built an independent treasury
Having done all this he sought no second term
But precious few have mourned the passing of
Mister James K. Polk, our eleventh president
Young Hickory, Napoleon of the Stump

You gave me a pet name
Which is not to say I like it
We met at a party
Not to say I was invited 
You said love was just a lie
But I could tell that you were lying
And we almost figured out how we'd get along
And given time we'd find it strange to be alone and
You work in a hotel
At the magazine concession
"Back in just five minutes"
Reads the sign above your station
Slip your profits in a bag
And you're looking up to the hour hand
And we've almost figured out how we'll get along
And given time we'll find it strange to be alone and
You just forgot your one pet name for me
And all those promises you said you'd keep
And it's a lucky thing
Because that sentimental stuff 
Doesn't suit you 
At all
Waiting at the bus stop 
For just about an hour
Strategies for hangman
Cat's cradle, origami
You say I'm okay for a guy
But I can tell that you are lying
And we've almost figured out how we'll get along
And given time we'll find it strange to be alone and
You just forgot your one pet name for me
And all those promises you said you'd keep
And it's a lucky thing
Because that sentimental stuff doesn't
You just forgot your one pet name for me
And all those promises you said you'd keep
And it's a lucky thing
Because that sentimental stuff 
Doesn't suit you 
At all

(Two, three, four)
I can hear you
Just barely hear you
I can just barely hear you
This is a warning
Step away from the car
This car is protected by Viper
Guess where I am
I'm calling from the plane
I'll call you when I get there
You won't hear a buzz
But I'm buzzing you in
I'm buzzing you in
What's your order?
I can super-size that
Please bring your car around
I can hear you
Just barely hear you
I can just barely hear you

With arms extended in a trance
Forgetting their washing

A voice is telling them to act a different way
They tilt their heads so they won't miss what it will say
(No) And when it's so

A girl with cotton in her ears
Is shielded from the bells' effect
As if by hidden signal
The people turn to face her
One thousand eyes are staring
They pull away her earplugs
The bells are pealing 
And they're revealing 
The simple key to happiness 
(Bong bong bong bong bong bong bong bong bong)
It isn't evil
It isn't good 
It's only what the people miss 
(Bong bong bong bong bong bong bong bong bong)
The bells explain what they've been lacking all along
They were disorganized and that was what was wrong

Back in high school I knew a girl
Not too simple and not too kind
We both grew up but I heard she changed 
From a new wave fan to another kind 
She thinks she's Edith Head 
But you might know she's not
The accent in her speech 
She didn't have growing up
She thinks she's Edith Head 
Or Helen Gurley Brown
Or some other cultural figure 
We don't know a lot about
It's been years since I moved away
But at Christmas I come home
And I saw her reflection 
In the window of a store
She was talking to herself
Not too simple and not too kind
I walked on by, it was complicated
And it stuck in my mind
She thinks she's Edith Head
But you might know she's not
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
(AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!)
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
 You guys want to listen to the whole thing...
"One more!..."
 ...before we get...
"...one more!..."
Okay - One more!
"...go!"
SHE'S LOST HER MIND! ("I ate a bug")
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now

Maybe I know that she's been a-cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do?
I hear them whispering as I walk by,
"She's gonna break his heart, and make him cry."
I know it's me they're talking about
I'll bet they all think I'll never find out
Oh
Maybe I know that she's been cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do?
My friends keep telling me that she's no good
"She isn't treating you the way she should."
I feel so badly, that's all I can say
Before my tears fall, I just walk away
Oh but maybe I know that she's been a-cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do?
Deep down inside, she loves me
Though she may run around
I know someday she'll love me
Someday she'll settle down
Maybe I know that she's been a-cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do?
Oh, maybe I know that she's been cheating
Maybe I know that she's been untrue
But what can I do?

Moths beat on the window pane
Telling me I'm not the same
Sounds of nothing, sounds of fear
Speak to me when no one's near
Come on Rat Patrol
I'm on Rat Patrol
Wilderness of mirrors shine
Floorboards creak or footsteps heard
Headlights turn into the drive
Then disappear into the night
I'm on Rat Patrol
Come on Rat Patrol
Yeah
Yeah

You're older than you've ever been and now you're even older
And now you're even older
And now you're even older
You're older than you've ever been and now you're even older
And now you're older still
Time
Is marching on
And time
Is still marching on
This day will soon be at an end and now it's even sooner
And now it's even sooner
And now it's even sooner
This day will soon be at an end and now it's even sooner
And now it's sooner still
You're older than you've ever been and now you're even older
And now you're even older
And now you're even older
You're older than you've ever been and now you're even older
And now you're older still

Operators are standing by
Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee
Bounce their shoes at the end of their feet
And wish they could go home 
Operators are standing by
Poking holes in the ceiling tiles
Making jokes about their old boyfriends and
Days gone by
Operators are standing by
Talking about their portrayal
On the TV where an actress sits
With a headset in outer space
That's enough talking, ladies
Operators are standing by
Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee
Pass 'round a picture of a mobius strip
And wish they could go home

No taxi could take you
No trains rolling by
No bicycle shop, no planes in the sky
Planes in the sky
Not a night spent in jail
Parrot on my arm
Not a man of the world, no patch on my eye
Patch on my eye
Dark and metric is my town
Every day and night
Just because you're floating
Doesn't mean you haven't drowned
No spoiler, no windscoop
No mag wheels in back
No hydraulic shocks, no privacy glass
Privacy glass
Dark and metric is my town
North, east, west, and south
Just because you're smiling
Doesn't mean you haven't drowned

Each night I lie awake
Completely alone
A voice is speaking, and I tremble
For it's not my own
My own
I can't ignore it
Although I try
The intrusive whisper fascinates me
Here's why
Here's why
The shadows gather 'round as the voice recites
The secret history of my immortal soul
Indestructible
Indefensible
Reprehensible
10,000 years of unerasable acts
And permanent facts
The record of my
Unspeakable crimes
In previous lives
In previous times
Indelibly stains
The pages of history
Indestructible
Indefensible
Reprehensible
Night after night the voice recites my misdeeds
And puts me to sleep
And tells me I won't
Remember a thing
When morning comes at last
I rub my eyes
Forgetting everything and thinking
Only of my plans
My plans
The world is spinning 'round and I'm on the top
And nothing in the world can ever make me stop
Indestructible
Indefensible
Reprehensible
10,000 years of unerasable acts
And permanent facts
And only I know
Who's responsible
Indefensible
Reprehensible
Me

The few surviving samurai survey the battlefield
Count the arms, the legs and heads, and then divide by five
Drenched in blood, they move across the screen
Do I need to point or do you see the one I mean?
The one in back
The way he acts
Is he reminding you
Of anyone we know?
Isn't he so
Like certain people I could name?
Halfway through the 30 minutes, halfway 'round the world
Here's the story on the genocidal overlord
In her palace with her epaulettes
Watch her little gestures as she lights her cigarette
Look at her, you
Must see it too
Is she reminding you
Of anyone we know?
Isn't she so
Like certain people I could name?
Disembodied and detached, a voice describes the scene
As a lizard stalks a helpless creature on TV
Music underscores the tragedy
Eyes with no expression watch the unsuspecting prey
Who is it like?
Doesn't it strike
You as the very image
Of someone we know?
Isn't it so
Like certain people
How could anybody miss
The obvious
And the uncanny and
The clear resemblance?
Isn't it just
Like certain people I could name?

Call out the undertaker
Call out the police
The counterfeit faker
Is coming after me
Yes I loved him like a brother
I loved him ambivalently
There's no way to measure
The damage he has done
Counterfeit faker
Carries a grudge
Nervous, I walk through windows
I walked through plate glass doors
Silent, his presence mocks me
And waves me on some more
Counterfeit faker
The damage has been done
Ah, do some damage, son
The damage has been done
The damage has been done
Counterfeit faker
Bring him on

Julie at the station says
They'll be here any minute now
But she's running out of records
And her show is ending anyhow
They can hear her saying
Their name on the car radio
But the signal keeps fading out
No matter which way They go
I heard They Might Be
Somewhere near this town
They Might Be Giants got lost
Driving around
John said to John
"I think we make a left at the light
There should be a big 'B'
assuming this map is right"
John looked over and he said,
"Hey, no it's not
It's a crumpled up wrapper
From the fast food that we got"
I heard They Might Be
Somewhere near this town
They Might Be Giants got lost
Driving around
Graham said to Brian
"I see somebody walking this way"
So Eric rolled down the window
And said, "Hello, excuse me, hey"
"Could you tell us where we are
And the best way out of here?"
They could tell from his expression
He had absolutely no idea
I heard They Might Be
Somewhere near this town
They Might Be Giants got lost
Driving around
Driving around
Driving around
They're still driving around

Have you ever seen a bloody egg?
Glass in hand, lying up in bed?
That's the time to sing this cowardly lullaby
And you ought to know why
Lullabye to nightmares whisper low
In the night where bat wings flow
That's where all the frightmares go
When the elephants die
Wouldn't you like to try?
Ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba-ba ba-ba
Ba ba-ba ba-ba  
Have you ever heard the blackbird's song?
Summer days all summer long
Underneath the shady tree 
A shadow sitting next to me
And we stare at the sun
Lullabye to nightmares whisper low
In the night where bat wings flow
That's where all the frightmares go
When the elephants die
Wouldn't you like to try?

Here's my song.
Her burden of things walking out
Her burden of things walking out
On earth my Nina
On earth my Nina
God forbid a vaguer feat
National hell mugged me
Say, the sparrow wants a morbid arrow
Here's a quarter, that's the one I won
Maybe I'll buy the whirlwind
That always keeps me yearning
Her sitter's down there mourning
Her burden of things walking out
Her burden of things walking out
On earth my Nina
On earth my Nina

The Edison Museum, not open to the public
Its haunted towers rise into the clouds above it
Folks drive in from out of town
To gaze in amazement when they see it
Just outside the gate I look into the courtyard
Underneath the gathering thunderstorm
Through the iron bars, I see the Black Maria
Revolving slowly on its platform
In the topmost tower, a light burns dim
A coiling filament glowing within
The Edison Museum, once a bustling factory
Today is but a darkened, cobweb covered hive of industry
The tallest, widest and most famous haunted mansion in New Jersey
Behind a wooden door, the voice of Thomas Alva
Recites a poem on a phonograph
Ghosts float up the stair, like silent moving pictures
The loyal phantoms of his in-house staff
A wondrous place it is, there can be no doubt
But no one ever goes in, and no one ever goes out
So when your children quarrel and nothing seems to quell them 
Just tell them that you'll take them to the Edison Museum 
The largest independently owned and operated mausoleum

Bangs
Above your eyes your hair hangs
Blow my mind, your royal flyness
I dig your bangs
Bangs
To drape across your forehead
To swing concordant angles
As you incline your head
Once with a girl I fell
In love some time ago
Now she had
Bangs (bangs)
Are that on which the world hangs (bangs)
I'm only holding your hand (bangs)
So I can look at your
Bangs
Bangs (bangs)
Are like a pocket t-shirt (bangs)
As casual as that
While fully intentional (bangs)
And in case you think I'm here
'Cause I like making chit-chat
Just remember what I said
The money's under your hat
Bangs (are that on which)
Are that on which the world hangs (I'm only holding)
I'm only holding your hand (so I can look)
So I can look at your
Bangs
Bangs (bangs)
Above your eyes your hair hangs
Blow my mind, your royal flyness
I dig your bangs
Bangs
To drape across your forehead
To swing concordant angles
As you incline your head (bangs)
And although I liked you anyway
Check out your haircut
A proscenium to stage a face
That needs no makeup
Bangs (bangs)
Are that on which the world hangs (bangs)
I'm only holding your hand (so I can look) (bangs)
So I can look at your bangs (I'm only holding) (bangs)
I'm only holding your hand (bangs)
So I can look at your
Bangs

I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
And then you go and waste my cyclops time
Mess up my cyclops mind
I'm sick
Like Chucky was sick
My defeated heart keeps beating on
I won't die
Like Chucky won't die
But I'm not here to socialize
Gotta find a new place to hang out
'Cause I'm tired of living in Hell
I'm a mess
Since you cut me out
But Chucky's arm keeps me company
I'm a fright
With my tombstone smile
All the children run away from me
Gotta find new friends to hang with
'Cause you're all afraid of me
And I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
And then you go and waste my cyclops time
Mess up my cyclops mind
Dan!
It was sweet
Like lead paint is sweet
But the after-effect left me paralyzed
I just stare
With my one glass eye
Hoping you won't be back again
There's a whole new generation
Waiting to be wrecked by you
I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
You waste my cyclops time
And mess up my cyclops mind
Pony, Twist, Monkey, and Frug
These are the things that I taught to you
Hitchhike, Boogie, Hypocrite Bop
I'm stuck in a van outside of New York
AAAAAAAAAHHH!
Taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
You waste my cyclops time
And I've got a cyclops mind

Man, it's so loud in here
They fixed up the corner store
Like it was a nightclub
It's permanently disco
Everyone is dressed so oddly
I can't recognize them
I can't tell the staff from the customers
Baby, check this out
I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
When they stop the drum machine
And I can think again
I'll remember what it was
You have to carry all your things
You can't misplace them
There's nowhere to place anything
Baby, check this out
I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
When they stop the drum machine
And I can think again
I'll remember what it was
They're all shouting something at us
Waving and pointing
They revamped the airport completely
Now it looks just like a nightclub
Everyone's excited and confused
Baby, check this out
I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
When they start the love machine
And I can love again
I'll remember what it was
Baby, check this out
I've got something to say
Man, it's so loud in here
(Man, it's so loud in here)
Man, it's so loud in here
(Man, it's so loud in here)
Man, it's so loud in here
(Man, it's so loud in here)
Man, it's so loud in here
(Man, it's so loud in here)
(Man, it's so loud in here)
(Man, it's so loud in here)
(Man, it's so loud in here)

I'm asleep, but she's talking to me
She's walking 'round wearing all of my clothes
As she runs out of things to say
And grabs my coat to walk away
"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?
Other people were too sentimental
And always worrying about their hair
Got tired of wasting all my time
Now I'm not worrying at all
"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?
You could tell me we belong together
And I could tell you you belong with me
But we've run out of things to say
And we'll be happy anyway so
"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?
"How 'bout another first kiss?" she said
"How 'bout another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How 'bout another first kiss?

Glistening white triangular tooth
Open up a can of tomato juice
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
Girlfriend took me to meet her dad
Didn't like me because I look so bad
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
Girlfriend took me to meet her mom
Her head exploded like a atom bomb
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
I've got a fang
Glistening white triangular tooth
Open up a can of tomato juice
I've got a fang

Hey, hovering sombrero
Gently waving in the air above the meadow
Softly floating in the sky outside the window
Hovering sombrero, don't be shy
Don't
Don't be shy
Don't be terrified (don't)
When you take yourself for granted (don't)
Feel rejected and unwanted, know
You're never just a hat (no)
You're never only just a hat, you know (no)
Hovering sombrero
Hovering sombrero
Time is flying like an arrow
And the clock hands go so fast, they make the wind blow
And it makes the pages of the calendar go
Flying out the window, one by one
'Til the 100 years are on the front lawn (no)
And the old, familiar things are mostly all gone
But the old sombrero just keeps hovering on (no)
Hovering sombrero, hover on
Don't be burdened by regrets or make (no)
Your failures an obsession
Or become embittered or possessed by ruined hopes (no no)
Remember, when you take yourself for granted (no)
Feel rejected and unwanted, know (no)
You're never just a hat (no)
You're never only just a hat, you know (no)

"Yo yo yo! Come on come on!" 
Now every evening, when all my day's work is through 
I call my baby, and ask her what we could do
I mention movies, she doesn't seem to dig that
And then she asks me, Why don't I come to her flat
And have some supper, and let the evening pass by
By playing records, the sounds of groovy hi-fi?
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"
My baby loves me, she gets me feelin' so fine
And when she loves me, she makes me know that she's mine 
And when she kisses, I feel the fire get hot
She never misses, she gives it all that she's got
And when she asks me if everything is okay
I give the answer, the only thing I can say
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"
We'll play a melody 
And turn the lights down low so that no one can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive in all the world 'cept you and me
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh
And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill (whoa)
It's hard to tell you, because I'm tremblin' still (whoa)
No need to ask me if everything is okay (whoa)
I got my answer, the only thing I can say (whoa)
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"
Ahh! Open your mind (whoa)
to electric guitars! (whoa)
Open your mind! (whoa)
We'll play a melody 
And turn the lights down low so that no one can see
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
We gotta do that, we gotta do that
And there'll be no one else alive in all the world 'cept you and me
Yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh
Yeh yeh yeh yeh
And pretty baby, I never knew such a thrill 
It's hard to tell you, because I'm tremblin' still
But pretty baby, I want you all for my own
I think I'm ready to leave those others alone
No need to ask me if everything is okay
I got my answer, the only thing I can say
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"
That's what I say
I say "yeh yeh"

I never knew what everybody meant
By endless, hopeless, bleak despair
Until one day when I found out
The first time I ever left my house
It saw me and followed me home
And stayed with me for my whole life
For years and years I wandered the earth
Condemned to a life of bleak despair
Then, one day, I looked around
And found it had disappeared
Hopeless bleak despair
It was always there
And then, one day, it disappeared
In a puff of smoke
In an unceremonious way
One day, it disappeared
All I had ever wanted in my life
Was only to be free of it
It drove away my family
It made me lose my job
Whenever anybody saw it
They'd say "get out of here"
For years and years I wandered the earth
Sick of my life, looking forward to death
Then, one day, I looked around
And found it had disappeared
Hopeless bleak despair
It was always there
And then, one day, it disappeared
In a puff of smoke
In an unceremonious way
One day, it disappeared
Hopeless bleak despair
Hopeless bleak despair
Hopeless bleak despair
For years and years I wandered the earth
Until I died and went to hell 
But my despair had ascended to heaven
That's how I finally got rid of it
Hopeless bleak despair
It was always there
And then, one day, it disappeared
In a puff of smoke
In an unceremonious way
One day, it disappeared
Hopeless bleak despair
It was always there
And then, one day, it disappeared
In a puff of smoke
In an unceremonious way
One day, it disappeared

I'll take back my piñata, it's wasted on you
Just spinning that pool cue all over the room
And give back the blindfold that's under your shoe
Let's drink, drink, this town is so great
Drink, drink, 'cause it's never too late
To drink, drink, to no big surprise
But what words rhyme with "buried alive"?
What words rhyme with "buried alive"?
You could be a float for the Fourth of July
Based on your theme of "Wallflowers Grown Wild"
Look through your peephole, you've won every prize
Let's drink, drink, this town is so great
Drink, drink, 'cause it's never too late
To drink, drink, to no big surprise
But what words rhyme with "buried alive"?
What words rhyme with "buried alive"?
In your monkey suit on a cigarette break
The lunchtime crowd, they won't even blink
But you'd be sad if they did
But you'll be sad
Let's drink, drink, this town is so great
Drink, drink, 'cause it's never too late
To drink, drink, to no big surprise
But what words rhyme with "buried alive"?
What words rhyme with "buried alive"?

My man
Muscles from hand to foot 
Completely coated in 
Uninterrupted skin 
My man 
Signals command 
The leg to follow orders 
Coming down from headquarters
Why then
Am I in bed?
I guess my man's 
Fallen out with my head
May I direct your attention to the following simile?
You're like the coasts of an ocean
Buried beneath is a submarine cable
Connecting the opposite shores that surround it
My man
How can he stand?
Your fingers could encircle 
Clear around the ankle
My man
Won't walk again
In conflict with express 
Instructions given by the brain
Why can't
The message be sent?
I guess my man's 
Fallen out with my head
When something happens to drag on the floor of the ocean
For instance, an anchor or mooring
The cable can be disrupted, and even be severed
Which halts the transmission across it
There is no way to repair the break
My man
Muscles from hand to foot
Completely coated in 
Uninterrupted skin
My man
Signals command 
The leg to follow orders 
Coming down from headquarters
My man
How can he stand?
My man
Muscles from hand to foot 
Completely coated in 
Uninterrupted skin (My man)
My man
Won't walk again

You're older than you've ever been
And now you're even older

You're older than you've ever been

Time

And time

This day will soon be at an end
And now it's even sooner
And now it's even sooner
And now it's even sooner
This day will soon be at an end
And now it's even sooner
And now it's sooner still
You're older than you've ever been
And now you're even older
And now you're even older
And now you're even older
You're older than you've ever been
And now you're even older
And now you're older still

It's knocking off my diamond wig
Knocking me down onto the platinum ground
Woke up in a beautiful dream
Alone
Alone
I got hit by a mink car
Hit by a mink car driven by a guitar
And the silver chauffeur says that it's all in your head
When you're 24-karat dead
Dead
Dead
In my dream
She is reaching past my hollow core
And her smile's
An open sign on an abandoned store
I got hit by a mink car
Hit by a mink car driven by a guitar
And the silver chauffeur says that it's all in your head
When you're 24-karat dead
Dead
Dead

The pro is here to lead the way
To save the day 
Wicked little critta!
He clips the puck from Bobby Orr
He shoots. He scores.
Wicked little critta!
As he proceeds to torch the place
As he proceeds to scorch the place
As he proceeds to torch the place
Scorcher!
Torture!
Scorcher!
Wicked little critta!
He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar
He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar
And he pops a wheelie on his mini-bike
And he burns rubber and he peels out
He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar
And he clips the ball from Havlicek
And Havlicek is used and abused
He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar
He decides to ditch and he ditches
And nobody knows where he ditched
He's a wicked little critta with a sissy bar
And he lays a patch on the tar
It's a wicked little guy
Wicked pissa little guy
Wicked scorcher little critta
He's a wicked little guy
Wicked little critta!
He's a dink
Way to go
I like him
I got problems

Now I'm telling the truth
I'm finished with lies
Lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now (lies, lie) 
I should have my head examined
They'll see when they look inside
I won't have to say a word
I'll stop thinking what I shouldn't be thinking
I'll make everyone believe me 
Can't you see I'm telling the truth?
I'm finished with lies
Lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now (lie, lie)
You'll think it's a lie
Couldn't we just put away the ancient history?
Throw up our hands at the unsolved mystery
I'm going to have my head examined
I'll prove you were wrong about me
Move the needle telepathically
I'll turn everything around and confuse you
I'll talk faster and faster 'til I lose you
I'll fix it so you can't remember what was true
And there'll be nothing to remind you
Starting now I'm telling the truth
I'm finished with lies
Lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now (lies, lie)
Now I'm telling the truth
I'm finished with lies
Lies
If you don't believe me now
You'll never believe me now (lie, lie)
Lies! Lies!
You'll think it's a lie (you'll think it's a lie)
You'll think it's a lie (you'll think it's a lie)
You'll think it's a lie

Back in high school I knew a girl
Not too simple and not too kind
We both grew up but I heard she changed
From a new wave fan to another kind
She thinks she's Edith Head
But you might know she's not
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
She thinks she's Edith Head
Or Helen Gurley Brown
Or some other cultural figure
We don't know a lot about
It's been years since I moved away
But at Christmas I come home
And I saw her reflection
In the window of a store
She was talking to herself
Not too simple and not too kind
I walked on by, it was complicated
And it stuck in my mind
She thinks she's Edith Head
But you might know she's not
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
The accent in her speech
She didn't have growing up
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
(AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!)
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
She thinks she's Edith Head 
She thinks she's Edith Head now
"One more! one more, go!"
SHE'S LOST HER MIND!
"Let's listen!"
"I ate a bug."
"I can't hear you at all."

I've been working hard
Trying to sing and play guitar
Growing out my hair
And practicing my stare
Paid to fake it
In a traveling band
And I'm working undercover for the man
Sha la la la la
Sha la la la la la
Planning midnight raids
On our unsuspecting fans
While the roadies rig
The video surveillance van
Paid to fake it
In a traveling band
And I'm working undercover for the man
Sha la la la la

Here on fibber island 
We strum rubber guitars
Our friends live on mars 
And we sew buttons on our cars
Here on fibber island
Our house is made of pie
Our dog is two miles wide
And all he talks about is pie
Here on fibber island 
We swim on the ground
Wheels are square not round
We eat chocolate by the pound
Here on fibber island (here on fibber island)
No one sings along (no one sings along)
We just ride giraffes (we just ride giraffes)
And wear bicycles for hats (and wear bicycles for hats)
To get to fibber island (oooooh)
You just close your eyes (oooooh)
Start fibbing in your mind (oooooh)
And see what you can find (oooooh)
Here on fibber island
We hide mittens in our hair
You might need to stare
To see the mittens in our hair
Come to fibber island
And strum rubber guitars
Meet our friends from mars
And sew buttons on our cars

Underneath a big clock at the corner of 5th Avenue and 22nd Street
I stood and waited for a girl I knew at the spot where we agreed to meet
It was four minutes of two
At four of two, I stood waiting for the girl
I was four minutes early for the date we had planned
I was planning to say I was in love with her
Just as soon as she showed for a two o'clock date
And the clock said four of two
At four of two, I was staring into space
She was not yet late, according to the clock
I was feeling nervous so I kept looking up
At the clock sticking out of the side of the building
And it still said four of two
At four of two, I began to feel tired
And I rubbed my eyes, and again I checked the time
It seemed as if the sky was growing dark...
But I felt reassured when I looked at the clock
And it still said four of two
I lay my head down on the sidewalk so in case she were coming I would have a better view
But no one was there so I stretched out and closed my eyes for a second or two
It was four minutes of two
At once I awoke to a futuristic world
There were flying cars and gigantic metal bugs
I'd grown a beard; it was long and white
But I knew that the girl would be coming very soon
For though everything had changed, there was still that clock
And it still said four of two

In a future time
Children will work together
To build a giant cyborg

No is no
No is always no
If they say no, it means a thousand times no
No plus no equals no
All no's lead to no no no
Finger pointing, eyebrows low
Mouth in the shape of the letter O
Pardon me—no!
Excuse me—no!
May I stay?
Can I go?
No, no, no
Do this—no!
Don't do that—no!
Sit, stay, roll over
No, no, no
Finger pointing, eyebrows low
Mouth in the shape of the letter O
Red means stop; do not go
No, no, no

When I was 39 years old, I heard a story. I found out that there're people walking among us who have superpowers. These people are called Supertasters. To a Supertaster, bitter fruits taste far more bitter, and sweets far more sweet. Then, just a few months ago, I had the chance to meet a real, live Supertaster named John Lee. And this is his true story:
Nothing tastes the same (nothing tastes the same)
To a Supertaster (Supertaster)
When he tastes a pear (tastes a pear)
It's like a hundred pears (it's like a million pears)
He's got superpowers (superpowers)
He is a Supertaster (Supertaster)
Every flavor explodes (explodes and explodes)
Explodes and explodes
John Lee Supertaster
Tastes more than we do
Everything has a flavor
Some flavors are too much
Can't shut his mouth (can't shut his mouth)
'Cause he's a Supertaster (Supertaster)
Though he looks like a man (talks like a man)
He is a Supertaster (Supertaster)
Can't drink coffee or beer (coffee or beer)
'Cause he's a Supertaster (Supertaster)
Loves ice cream and pie (ice cream and pie)
He is a Supertaster
John Lee Supertaster
Tastes more than we know
Everything has a flavor
Some flavors must go

There's a house at the top of a tree
There's a house at the top of a tree
In the house there's a room
In the room there's a chair
And sitting in the chair is you
There's a nose at the end of a snout 
Of a dog with his head out the window
Of a car that's driving away from the tree
And at the top of a tree there's a house 
And in the house there's a room and in the room
There's a chair and in the chair is you
There's a plan to eat the house 
In the mind of a mouse in the woods
And the mouse in the woods has a smell that's detected
By the nose at the end of a snout of a dog 
And the dog has his head out the window of a car
And the car is driving away from the tree
And at the top of a tree there's a house
And in the house there's a room and in the room
There's a chair and in the chair is you
There are no more potato chips left
In the empty bag in your hand
And the crumpling sound of the empty bag
Makes the mice get mad
And when the mice get mad
It leads to a plan to eat the house
And the plan's in the mind of the mouse in the woods
And the mouse in the woods has a smell that's detected
By the nose at the end of a snout of a dog
And the dog has his head out the window of a car
And the car is driving away from the tree
And at the top of a tree there's a house
And in the house there's a room and in the room
There's a chair and in the chair is you
And the reason there are no more chips 
In the empty bag in your hand
Is that the crumpling sound of the empty bag 
Makes the mice get mad
Which leads to a plan 
To eat the house
But just in time 
The dog arrives 
To give to the mouse
The potato chips 
That you took from the bag 
And gave to the dog 
To deliver to the mouse
So the mouse would not eat you

Now broom you must now sweep for me
The dust it fills my room
No John I will not sweep for you
For I am not your broom
What nonsense are you speaking broom?
My words you must obey
Another life awaits me
And I'm leaving you today
I am not your broom
I am not your broom
I've had enough I'm throwing off
My chains of servitude
I am not your broom 
I am not your broom
No longer must I sweep for you
For I am not your broom

Lazyhead wants to rest

When Lazyhead uses imagination
Sleepybones daydreams
Sleepybones says, "It's not what it looks like"

The day is done
The sun is down
The curtains have been drawn
And darkness has descended over everything in town
The covers have been turned and I've got my pajamas on
I've had my fun
I've stretched and yawned and all is said and done
I'm going to bed
Bed bed bed bed bed
I've done so many things today
There's nothing left to do
I ate three meals, I rode my bike, I hung out with my friends
I did my chores, I watched TV, I practiced the guitar
I brushed my teeth, I read my book, and then I sat around
I'm going to bed
Bed bed bed bed bed
Moo
Moo
Moo
Moo
Oh it's pointless staying up for even twenty seconds more
When everything has happened and there's nothing else in store
The thing is now to lay my head down, close my eyes, and snore
And so to bed directly I go
The day is done
The sun is down
The curtains have been drawn
And darkness has descended over everything in town
The covers have been turned and I've got my pajamas on
I've had my fun
I've stretched and yawned and all is said and done

Bed bed bed bed bed

See them over there
See them moving down the road
Their arms held out ahead
And their eyes, their eyes are closed
Don't make any noise
Cry out loud or stamp your feet
You'll wake the girls and boys
Who are walking in their sleep
Every night they throw aside their blankets
Swing their feet down
Stand up and move out to the street
Like they're under a spell
And together they roam across the country
And they're walking in their sleep
You'll recognize them when you see
Their rumpled hair and stocking feet
It seems like they want something
But we don't know what it is
But here they come again
Yes, here they come again
Move aside and let the people go by
They don't see you
Thinking that they're home in their beds
They must not be disturbed
When they're wandering all across the country
And they're walking in their sleep
Perhaps when they awake
They'll remember everything
They'll think it was a dream
It will be forgotten then
But don't make any noise
Cry out loud or stamp your feet
You'll wake the girls and boys
Who are walking in their sleep

It's for this experimental film
Which nobody knows about
And which I'm still figuring out
What's going to go in my experimental film
Yeah, you're all gonna be in this experimental film
And even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it's
I already know the ending it's
The part that makes your face implode
I don't know what makes your face implode
But that's the way the movie ends
And in my experimental film
Which nobody knows about
But which I'm still figuring out
Your face implodes at my experimental film
Yeah, you're all gonna be in this experimental film
And even though I can't explain it
I already know how great it's

I already know how great it's

I've been draggin' my feet across my back
And I've been rubbin' my head against my neck
And I've been walkin' my fingers through my mind
And I've been feelin' this feelin' in my spine
And I believe I'll be leavin' it behind
When I don't need a spine

I'll be in the back, and I don't need the help
I'm good here in the back
I'm good all by myself
I'm busy taking stock of all the things that I've forgot (5 4 3 2)
And making mental notes of just exactly where I lost the plot (2 2 2 2)
I stuck around too long feeling sorry for myself
A disinvited guest rifles through the bathroom shelf
I'm searching for some disbelief that I can still suspend (5 4 3 2)
But never mind the furthermore-the plea is self-defense again (2 2 2 2)
Then the people came to talk me down
And I got some advice
Then the people came to talk me down
But I don't need advice; I'm down
Later in my car I considered what you said
I'm good here in my car
I'm good with what you said
And I'd be shouting out to you but I was mighty hoarse
Talk you through the finer points and issues much too small to force
Then the people came to talk me down
And I got some advice
Then the people came to talk me down
But I don't need advice; I'm down

Wearing a raincoat is flying around
In a plane made of a raincoat
But when you think of that you hurt your mind
And you'll need a friend to talk you down
Needing a friend to talk you down
Is food that comes from a pipe
But when you hate the food that comes from a pipe
You will turn to drugs to help you sleep
Turning to drugs to help you sleep
Will only lead to sleep
And sleeping is a gateway drug to being awake
being awake, being awake again
Being awake is swimming around
In a lake of the undead
And the undead are like a bunch of friends
That demand constant attention
Demanding constant attention
Will only lead to attention
And once they have your attention
They use it to ask for attention
And once they have that attention
They use it to ask for attention
Wearing a raincoat is flying around
In a yellow rubber airplane made out of a raincoat
Yes, but when you think of that, you hurt your mind
And you'll need your mind for later on
Needing a mind for later on
Is a friend that comes at a price
But when you hate the friend that comes at a price
You will play the drums to help you sleep

I know, I know, I said that I would quit
All right, I promise, no more after this
You don't know how I've tried
To forget what it was like
I remember now
I remember now
Why they called it Thunderbird
Why they called it Thunderbird
Man, oh man, my throat is dry
Man, are you thinking what I
Am? Well what about it then?
Before you fall, you have to learn to crawl
You can't see heaven when you're standing tall
To get the whole sky
On the ground you have to lie
I remember now
I remember now
Why they called it Thunderbird
Why they called it Thunderbird
We like fun, me and my girl
We'll have fun fun fun until
T-bird takes her dad away
I know, I know, I said that I'd desist
All right, I promise, no more after this
Not to be what I was like
Not to soar across the sky
Spread my thunder wings and fly
Spread my thunder wings and fly
I remember now
I remember now
Why they called it Thunderbird
Why they called it Thunderbird

He says he knows me
But I don't know that guy
He's waving at me
But he looks kind of mad
Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
He's waving me over so he can hit me
But I don't know that guy
And I'm not going over there
Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
How has it come to this pass?
How can I get to my car?
Climb in, turn the ignition
Pull onto the highway
Where I am free
Some crazy bastard wants to hit me
He's waving me over so he can hit me
And who the hell is he?
I can't believe this is happening
That crazy bastard wants to hit me

I'm trapped in a world before later on
I'm trapped in a world before later on
Where's my hovercraft?
Where's my jet pack?
Where's the font of acquired wisdom that eludes me now?
We're trapped in a world before later on
We're trapped in a world before later on
Where's our telray?
Where's our space face?
Where are all the complications we won't see around?

They built this whole neighborhood
Out of wood, out of wood
I guess I'll still be around
When they burn, burn it down
I will be standing around

Here in the museum of idiots
Honey, I'm there when you need me
Please believe me, please believe me
I'll still be right where you left me
If you manage to forget me
Where we met
Is where you may forget
Here in the museum of idiots
If you and I had any brains
We wouldn't be in this place
Chop me up into pieces
If it pleases, if it pleases
And when the chopping is through
Every piece will say "I love you"
Every piece of me
Will say "I love you"
Here in the museum of idiots
Every piece of me
Will say "I love you, you, you"
Here in the museum of idiots

Shocked awake in the middle of the day
In a fight over shadows of the night
And you wonder why the talk is so bold
When it's boring and the story's so old
Panicked call to her best friend on the phone
Won't sit down but she just can't sit alone
Hard to justify a party band
To somebody with no party plans

David Bowie came to town
Flying overhead
"Don't you dig my chops?" he cried
This is what they said
Au contraire, Dave
Quite the opposite, in fact
As it happens, au contraire
Au contraire, mon frère
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
Knew not what to do
"This tie clashes with my hat," he cried
"Don't you think that's true?"
Au contraire, Delano
Hate to rain on your parade

Jodie Foster held two pair
Bach had three of a kind
Gandhi said, "With my full house,
I will blow your mind!"
Au contraire, Mahatma
Hate to contradict you, but
As it happens, au contraire
Au contraire, yes au contraire
And au contraire, you square
Wash that notion from your hair
If you're still there, I must declare
Au contraire, mon très
Bon frère

I'm not much of a natural dancer
But I've got a friend who's a natural dancer
You could call her a jumpin' bean
She's got ants in her pants and she's gonna dance
I know a girl who's a jumpin' bean
She's got keys and a token when she hits the scene
Yeah I know a girl who's got a record machine
She acts like David Lee Roth when he turned 21
I know a girl who's a natural dancer
With a cape and a hat she's a natural dancer
She coughs and she laughs and she makes a lot of calls
And all of the people applaud
As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)
As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)
Can she do the karaoke? Yes she can, but she won't
'Cause she's highly qualified and she's not a joke
When it comes to opera, she is ossified
So all of you operas better step aside
When my friend got amnesia
She can't remember the show she saw
Like the one with the guy with amnesia
Who got off of the island on a helicopter
I know a girl who's a natural dancer
With a cape and a hat she's a natural dancer
She coughs and she laughs and she makes a lot of calls
And all of the people applaud
As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)
As she leaves the store
As she leaves the store (damn good times)
All of the people applaud (damn good times)

You said something before you left
Something I was not to forget
Then 
Is when I maybe should have wrote it down
But when I looked around to find a pen
And then I tried to think of what you said
We broke in two
Busted through
Broke in two
I would go back to the top of the day from scratch
If I thought this thing could be fixed
Though sadly I'd do exactly the same thing as when
We broke in two
Busted through (Broke in two)
Broke in two
You said "I'm gonna run you down"
I heard "I'm an orangutan"
Then 
Is when I maybe should have wrote it down
But when I looked around to find a pen
And then I tried to think of what you said
We broke in two
Busted through
Broke in two
I would go back to the top of the day from scratch
If I thought this thing could be fixed
Though sadly I'd do exactly the same thing as when
We broke in two (Broke in two)
Busted through (Broke in two)
Broke in two (Broke in two)
I'm an orangutan (Broke in two)
Busted through (Broke in two)
Broke in two (Broke in two)
I'm an orangutan (Broke in two)
Busted through
Broke in two
I'm an orangutan

I went for a walk (on a stalk)
On a stalk of wheat
And it felt like a trillion feet
I was looking for a friend (at the end)
At the end of the line
And it took me 'till the end of time
I was all out of luck (like a duck)
Like a duck that died
I was all out of juice (like a moose)
Like a moose denied
I was all out of money
Like a bunny that's broke
I was all out of work
Like a jerk who's a joke
And I was out of ideas
Like I is, like I is
Like I is, like I is
I was out of ideas
Of ideas
I once had a dream (of a gleam)
Of a gleam in my eye
And I'll have it till the day I die
I had a thought bubble (of trouble)
Of trouble and strife
And I'll have it for the rest of my life
I was all out of luck (like a duck)
Like a duck that died
I was all out of juice (like a moose)
Like a moose denied
I was all out of money
Like a bunny that's broke
I was all out of work
Like a jerk who's a joke
And I was out of ideas
Like I is, like I is
Like I is, like I is
I was out of ideas
Of ideas
Of ideas

I've got my house surrounded
I know I'm in there
Come out with both my hands up
And don't make me come in and get me
Don't make me come in and get me
I can't hide from my mind
Though I try, try, try
I can't hide from my mind
And you know why
Running against the traffic
To find where I lost you
I'm catching up to the echoes
And I hear your voice from the buildings
I hear your voice from the buildings
I can't hide from my mind
Though I try, try, try
I can't hide from my mind
And you know why
The bars are in my eyes
And kisses make you cry
Smiles turned out misleading
And memory's a lie
I've got my house surrounded
I know I'm in there
Come out with both my hands up
And don't make me come in and get me
Don't make me come in and get me
Don't make me come in and get me

Though I don't write a whole lot of letters
I figured I'd better say something now
I saw the thing about the heartsick shut-in
Thought that I should cut in
And tell you 'bout how
It woke me from a life-long daydream
While I'd been aging you wrote it all down
And though I recognized the words when I read them
I know I never said them to people out loud

I wanna be a much better person
Instead I worsen with every day
But there's a drug whose name I'm not sure of
Which I need more of to feel okay
They told me exercise and diet
If I would try it, would cure my ills
But though I'm already past my quota
I want another load o' those magic pills

To whatever that thing is
That makes the carpet stop turning into snakes
In lieu of my coming conniption

Standing outside the unopened pharmacy

A hardly has an appetite
And pokes at food too long
And B can barely bother
Because all the food is wrong
C likes only candy
And chocolate by the box
D is just disinterested
In anything you've got 
But E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything
E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 
So toss it on a plastic plate
Or stick it with a fork
Serve it with a shovel
Or serve it on a spork 
Yeah, E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 
F is far too fussy
And only eats with fancy wine
G eats only gourmet
But never can decide
H burns food so horrible
All I tastes is smoke
J just likes drinking juice
And K drinks only soda 
But E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 
E is eating in a moving car
E is eating upside down
E is eating on a spaceship
E is eating off the ground
L and M and N and P
Won't start 'til O arrives
Q and R and S and T
Are wearing clothes much too tight
U and V and W
Are worn out from this song
And X and Y just will not share
And will not get along 
But E eats everything
Yeah, E eats everything 
But look out now, here it comes
That final letter Z
Now Z's not like the other letters
Z's only eating Es
Yeah, Z eats Es
Yeah, Z eats Es
Z eats Es
Yeah, Z eats Es

Flying V
If you're standing underneath it, you will see when you inspect it
That a flying V is made of flying geese
The pointed end flies in the lead
So when it flies, it's hard to read
You've got to tip your head to see
Flying V, Flying V
It's a V
In the window of a music store, or on stage at a rock show
Now a flying V is made of a guitar
The pointed end flies in the lead
So when it flies, it's hard to read
You have to be upside-down to see it

Gazelles out in the field
Goats are in the barnyard
And gophers in their holes
Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G
You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
When you go go go go for G
Goofballs in their go-carts
Girl scouts chewing gum
Grandma with her gingerbread
And the drummer plays a gong
Go go go go for G
Go go go go for G
You'll feel gracious, gigantic, grateful and glad
When you go go go go for G
Grapes, glue, gyroscopes
Go go go go for G

You'll feel glorious, generous, gleeful and great
When you go go go go for G

There goes D, Captain D
My boy D, Commander D, the well-known D

D is shy and doesn't get out of the house much anymore

They call it W, there's that W
It thinks it's king, its all-time favorite thing is W
D: W, you think you're so great.
W: Well, I am pretty big.
D: Yeah, you're okay.  You're just not as great as you think you are.
W: How come I never see you around anymore, D?
D: I got this big TV set at home now.  And I like to watch the sports.

Can you find the hidden 'H'
Where it's hiding?
Is it on the ground
Or in the sky 
Or part of something here?
Does it fit somewhere inside?
Is there somewhere it can hide?
Can you find it?
Can you find it?
Can you find it?
There it is
Where's the secret 'R'?
Can you see it?
Is it in the train 
Or on the tracks 
Or at the station-house?
Is the 'R' inside the tree?
Where oh where can it be?
Can you find it?
Can you find it?
Can you find it?
There it is
Where is the 'L'?
Is it under the chair?
Is it growing in the hair?
Where could it be?
We have looked everywhere
And I'm sorry to say
That it's part of the 'H'
Which isn't fair
(Spoken)
W: Now where are you hiding, D?
D: Oh, you're never going to find me.  But my question to you is, W, where are you hiding?
W: I have no idea.  I've been looking everywhere.
Where is the 'M'?
Is it invisible?
Or is that against the rules?
Where can it be?
Well, it's right in front of you
And I'll give you a clue
It's an upside-down 'W'
There are letters everywhere in this picture
There's a 'B', an 'F', a 'Z', an 'X', a 'P', an 'O', a 'Y'
There's a sideways letter 'Q'
The aforementioned 'W'
Can you find them?

Here's a song that features a musical family of vowels!
And it's performed by some friends of ours 
called the Deeply Felt Puppet Theater.
We want to thank 'em for helping us out.

A I Y, O E U 
We're the Vowel Family, and we've come to sing for you
Vowels are important letters, there's a vowel in every word
Vowels are important letters, there's a vowel in every word
Ask someone older to show you, there's a vowel in each word
Vowels are important letters, there's a vowel in every word

We're the Vowel Family, and we're back to sing some more
A is an important letter
Well I is important too

What's that?
That is a letter.
What is that?
That's not a letter.
That's a letter.
That's not a letter.
That is a letter.
Is that a letter?
I don't know what that is.
That's so a letter.
What is that?
Whatever it is, that's not a letter.
That's a letter.
Is that a letter, or what?
That's a letter. Only it's upside down.

On this fateful day in the history of whenever, an epidemic of missing letters has swept the land. Whatever the cause, for the sake of future generations, in the limited time we have been permitted, these stories must be told.
There was an apple that lost his 'a'
There was a zebra that lost his 'z'
There was a chauffeur that left his 'auffeur' on the dashboard
Of the car that lost its 'r'
Well, the car had lost its 'r' in a pothole
On a street that lost its 'e'
When the garbage collector with a missing 'ector' swept it up
With a broom that lost its 'oom'
Where they gonna go without their letters?
How can they survive without their letters?
Where they gonna go to find their letters?
They're gonna have to get together

At the alphabet lost and found (alphabet lost and found)
(Prefixes and suffixes, door number two)
(Slang words, you're in the wrong building)
There was a school that lost its 'cool'
When they tried to ring the bell that had no 'll'
With all the letters gone, the spelling bee was canceled
Science teachers had their hands full
English classes could not be complete
Where they gonna go without their letters?
How can they survive without their letters?

All right!
Back in ancient times
You know that things then weren't that easy
So many different tribes
So many different ways of writing
So, who put the alphabet in alphabetical order?
I wonder
Who put the alphabet in alphabetical order?
Oh
Now I've got a question
With an answer that you might find easier
You've got to use your mind
To remember all the letters in order
Now, you put the alphabet in alphabetical order
Come on!
You put the alphabet in alphabetical order
We're going to put the alphabet in alphabetical order now
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y and Z
Now I know my ABCs
Next time won't you play with me?
Oh, I put the alphabet in alphabetical order
Yes, I put the alphabet in alphabetical order

Or a two-by-four frame of a house
It's probably made from pine trees
And pine trees are conifers
That's what this song is about
Or if you see a plant
In the shape of an elephant
Or in the shape of a dog
It's probably a shrub
A conifer shrub
Pruned into that shape by someone
Most with cones for seeds
Most with needles for leaves
C is for conifers
My kind of trees
Larch, junipers and fir
Spruce, cedars, and pines
C is for conifers
More than five hundred kinds
There are so many different kinds of conifer trees. This is just a few of them:
Spruce
Hemlocks
Larch
Cyprus
Juniper
Fir
Douglas fir
Cedar
Yew
Pine
The dwarf conifer
And the great California sequoia redwood
Most with cones for seeds
Most with needles for leaves
C is for conifers
My kind of trees
Larch, junipers and fir
Spruce, cedars and pines
C is for conifers
More than five hundred kinds

F is for fun, F is for fun
F is for fake-believe
My space helmet's on
I'm climbin' in my rocket
To Mars and beyond
And nothin's gonna stop me
I'm here on the launch pad
Just waitin' for the big countdown
(4 3 2 1 Blast off!)
F is for fun, F is for fun
F is for fake-believe
I'm scratchin' my thorax
And wavin' my antennas
I'm here on my ant hill
Just hangin' with my ant friends
I've got my big crumb
About 30 times my weight
(It's not a problem, ants are strong!)
F is for fun, F is for fun
F is for fake-believe
Fake-Believe, Fake-believe, Fake-believe
Fake-Believe, Fake-believe, Fake-believe
Fake-Believe, Fake-believe, Fake-believe
F is for Fake-Believe

Hey John.
Oh hey John.
What's going on?
Man, I'm confused.
You're confused, why?
I I'm no good at remembering stuff.
Really?
Yeah.
Like what?
I can't remember what D is for!
You can't remember what D is for?!
I think it's for an instrument you play in a band.
I'm surprised you can't remember what D is for.
I can't remember; there's too much noise.
Put your thinking cap on, John, I'll give you a hint.
See I can't find my thinking cap, I think it's lost!
John, come on tell me, D is for what?
D is for something that you play with sticks.
That's right, that's right, you're getting close.
D is for Drums, yes D is for Drums!
D is for Drums, yes D is for Drums!
Well, I'm glad we got that straight.

Okay. I'll meet you over there.
Okay.
