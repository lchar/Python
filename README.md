# Python
Some python scripts and notebooks I created. There used to be more of them but I created separate repositories for them.

* DSE 200X: Metropolitan Museum Project, to be deleted, as it is its own repository now.
* TMBG: A Python script that counts the number of single words used by the band They Might be Giants among their first 35,000 first words in album songs.
